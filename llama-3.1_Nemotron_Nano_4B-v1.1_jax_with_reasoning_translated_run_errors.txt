    Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by understanding what the original code does. It's a simple linear regression model using Mean Squared Error loss. The model has one linear layer, trains for 100 epochs, saves the model, loads it, and tests.
                                                                                                                        ^

    1. **Layer Indexing Differences**: JAX's ResNet models have different layer indices compared to PyTorch. The original code assumes layer indexing from PyTorch, which might not hold in JAX. For ResNet-18 in JAX, the final layer is `layer 'o'`.

    The code uses PyTorch functions and modules. To convert to JAX, replace PyTorch modules with their JAX equivalents. For example, `torch.nn.Linear` becomes `jax.nn.Linear`, and `torch.optim` uses `jax.optim`. Additionally, JAX requires input to be a JAX array (string or number array), and tensor operations use `.to(jax.numpy)`. However, for better performance, it's recommended to use JAX's high-level APIs like `jax.devices`, `jax.train`, and `jax.evaluate`. But since the user asked for direct translation, here's the equivalent code:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ^
