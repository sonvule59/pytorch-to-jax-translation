# Use jax.numpy for tensor operations, jax.shuffles for shuffling data, and jAX vjs for JIT compilation. Translate PyTorch code to JAX-compatible code, using JAX's equivalents for data handling, model definition, and optimization.

# First, replace PyTorch with JAX for data loading. Use pandas to read CSV as before, but convert to JAX tensors.

# Then, define the Dataset class in JAX. Note that JAX doesn't have a built-in DataLoader like PyTorch, so we'll create a custom dataloader using jax.shuffles.

# For the model, use JAX's equivalents for defining neural networks. Use jax.vajv.jaxv.jaxv.jaxv import necessary modules.

# For the training loop, use jax.train to automate the training loop with automatic differentiation.

# For optimization, JAX doesn't have an exact equivalent of SGD, but we can use jax.optim.traj from jax.optim.

# Also, note that JAX requires all operations to be in a jax.function, so the training loop should be wrapped in jax.train.

# Handling the model's forward pass and loss is similar, but using JAX's native modules.

# So, translating step by step:

# Data Loading:
# - Use pandas to read CSV, then convert to JAX arrays.

# Dataset Class:
# - In JAX, the Dataset can be implemented using jax.random.PRNGState if needed, but since we're using shuffling, use jax.shuffles.shuffle.

# Model Definition:
# - Use JAX's nn.Module (if using jax.vajv.jaxv.jaxxv.jaxv.jaxv import, but actually, jax has its own nn, but for compatibility, maybe use jax.nn).

# Wait, JAX has its own nn module, but it's not as extensive as PyTorch's. For a simple linear regression, we can define a module with a linear layer.

# Optimizer:
# - Use jax.optim.traj which includes SGD.

# Training Loop:
# - Use jax.train to handle the training loop.

# So, the JAX code would look something like this:

import jax
import pandas as pd

# Initialize JAX
jax.config.update_default(jax._compute_default_jax_config())

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X, y = data[['X', 'y']].to_jax_array()

# Define the Dataset (using jax.random and jax.shuffles)

    jax.random.set_random_state(random_state)
    jax.shuffles.shuffle(data, rng=jax.random.PRNGState(42))
    return data

# Create dataset and dataloader
dataset = dataset_jit(data=data, random_state=42)
shuffled_data = jax.shuffle(dataset, rng=jax.random.PRNGState(42))

# Custom Dataset (since JAX doesn't have a built-in Dataset, we'll use a list and index)
# But for efficiency, better to use jax.array_split and reshuffle

# Alternatively, use jax.random.PRNGState for shuffling within the dataset
