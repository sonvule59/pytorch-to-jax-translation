<<Pytorch code converted to JAX code>>
Output only code.

<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalent. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses 'torch' and 'torch.nn', but JAX doesn't have these. Instead, JAX uses 'jax.numpy' as the main array type and 'jax.nn.functional' for layers. However, the code here uses custom modules and functions, so I'll need to adjust the imports accordingly. But the user said to output only code, so maybe the imports stay similar but replace torch with jax. Wait, but in JAX, you don't import torch at all. Hmm, but the original code might have other dependencies. The user's example shows the PyTorch imports, but the JAX code would need to use jax equivalents. However, the user's instruction is to output only the converted code, so perhaps the imports are left as is but with jax where possible. Wait, no. The original code has 'import torch', which in JAX isn't used. So maybe the JAX code won't have those imports. But the user's example shows the PyTorch code, and the converted JAX code should replace the parts. Let me check the code structure.

Looking at the class _Adjacency, which is a PyTorch module. In JAX, modules are defined using jax.macro._Module. So the __init__ method and forward method need to be adapted.

The 'Histogram' and 'BatchMatrixMonitor' classes are from the'monitors' module. The JAX version might have similar classes but under jax.monitors. Also, the matrix activation function 'MATRIX_ACTIVATIONS' is a dictionary, which in JAX could be from jax.nn.functional or a custom import.

The 'MATRIX_ACTIVATIONS' in the original code is a predefined set, so in JAX, maybe it's from jax.nn.functional.attn or another module. But since the user's code uses a custom activation, perhaps the JAX equivalent would use functions like jax.nn.functional.gelu or mobius. However, without knowing the exact definitions, I'll keep it as a dictionary for now, assuming that the keys map to JAX equivalents.

The 'initialize' method in PyTorch is used to initialize modules, which in JAX would be handled via macro modules. So the _Adjacency class in JAX would be a jax.macro._Module.

The 'dij_histogram' and 'dij_matrix_monitor' are custom monitors. In JAX, these might be implemented using jax.numpyHistogram and jax.batchedMatrixMonitor, but since the original code has custom classes, perhaps they are adapted. However, the user's code might expect similar class names but under JAX's namespace.

The 'raw_matrix' function is undefined in the original code, but in forward, they compute M. In JAX, matrix operations are done via jax.numpy matrix operations or using jax.matmul.

The forward method in PyTorch does several things: raw_matrix, applies symmetry, applies activation, and monitors. In JAX, the raw_matrix would be a jax.numpy array. The symmetry would use transpose and element-wise operations. The activation would use JAX functions.

Also, the logging method in PyTorch checks if epoch is not None and logs every logging_frequency steps. In JAX, the logging would be similar but using JAX's plotting functions.

So, putting this together:

The _Adjacency class in JAX would be a jax.macro._Module. The __init__ method would set up the module's parameters. The forward method would perform the computations using JAX operations.

For the monitors, since they are histogram-based and batched matrix monitors, JAX has jax.numpyHistogram and jax.batchedMatrixMonitor. But the original code's custom monitors might need to be adapted. However, the user's code uses classes like Histogram and BatchMatrixMonitor, so in JAX, these would be from jax.monitors or similar.

The activation function 'MATRIX_ACTIVATIONS' would need to be replaced with JAX equivalents. For example, if 'act' is 'gelu', then self.activation would use jax.nn.functional.gelu.

But since the user's code uses a dictionary, perhaps the keys are the same, and the values are JAX functions. So in the JAX code, the activation would be applied using those functions.

Putting all this together, here's the step-by-step conversion:

1. Replace PyTorch imports with JAX equivalents where possible. But the user's code might have custom monitor classes, so those would stay as is but under JAX's namespace.

2. The _Adjacency class becomes a jax.macro._Module. The __init__ method initializes the module's parameters. The 'initialize
