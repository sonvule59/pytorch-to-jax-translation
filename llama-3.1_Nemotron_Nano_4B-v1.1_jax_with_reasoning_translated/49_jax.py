Use XLA compiler. No dynamic shapes, assume input shapes are compatible.

Here's the JAX equivalent code. Note that JAX uses similar syntax but requires XLA compilation. Some PyTorch functions are automatically compatible, but some may need adjustments. Also, JAX uses `jax.numpy` instead of `torch`.

Given the original PyTorch code, provide only the JAX equivalent code using step-by-step reasoning without explanations or markdown.

Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by understanding the original code. The MemN2N class uses a CNN for context embeddings and an attention mechanism. The forward method iterates over hops, applying attention each time.

First, JAX uses `jax.numpy` instead of `torch`. So I'll replace all `torch.` with `jax.numpy.` except for modules that might need autograd setup. Wait, but in JAX, even `nn` modules might need to be defined differently. Oh, right, JAX has `jax.nn.Module`, but sometimes people use `jax.nn.Module` or just use JAX's higher-level APIs. However, the user wants equivalent code, so I'll stick to JAX's equivalents.

Looking at the imports: The original uses `torch.nn as nn` and `torch.autograd.Variable as V`. In JAX, `import jax.numpy as jnp` and `import jax.nn as jnn`, but maybe the user wants to use JAX's `jax.device` for devices. Also, JAX doesn't use `torch.autograd.Variable` in the same way. So perhaps replace `V` with `jax.numpy.ndarray` or just use JAX's functions directly.

The CNN class is imported from'model.cnn', which should be accessible in JAX as long as it's in the same path. So that part stays.

In the MemN2N __init__, the code initializes layers. The embedding is done with `nn.Embedding`, which in JAX would be `jax.nn.Linear`? Wait, no. JAX's `jax.nn.Linear` is similar to PyTorch's `nn.Linear`, but maybe the user expects to use `jax.nn.Embedding`. So replace `nn.Embedding` with `jax.nn.Embedding`.

Similarly, the CNN is initialized with `CNN(param, embedding=self.embedding)`. Assuming the CNN is compatible, that line stays as is, but using JAX's CNN if available. Wait, the original code's CNN might be a custom or third-party module. Since the user hasn't provided the CNN code, I'll assume it's compatible and use JAX's JIT compilation.

The forward method: The original code uses `self.cnn(utter)`, which in JAX would be `self.cnn(jax.numpy(utter))`. But in JAX, functions are often applied directly to JAX arrays. So maybe replace `torch.sum` with `jnp.sum`, etc.

Wait, the original code has lines like `utter_emb_sum = self.cnn(utter)`. In JAX, if `utter` is a JAX array, then `self.cnn(utter)` should work if `self.cnn` is a JAX-compatible module. But the CNN might need to be JIT compiled. However, the user's instruction is to output code, not to handle JIT compilation steps. So perhaps the code remains similar, but using JAX's functions.

Looking at the forward method:

Original line: `utter_emb_sum = self.cnn(utter)`. Assuming `utter` is a tensor, in JAX, this would work if the module is compiled. But since the user wants equivalent code, I'll keep the structure but use JAX's functions where necessary.

The line `contexts = [utter_emb_sum` initializes contexts. In JAX, this would be similar, but the initial context is the output of the CNN on the utter.

In the loop for hops, the code processes memory. The original code unbounds the memory, embeds it, sums, etc. In JAX, handling unbounded tensors might be different. Wait, the original code uses `torch.unbind(memory, 1)` to unbound the memory. In JAX, unbounded tensors are handled differently. But the code provided in the example uses `memory_unbound = torch.unbind(memory, 1)`, which in JAX would be `jax.unbounded.Tensor.unbind(memory, axis=1)`? Or maybe JAX has a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the memory is already unbounded, so the code can process it directly.

But the user's code example includes `memory = torch.ones(20, 3, 10).long()`, which is a bounded tensor. But in the loop, they unbound it. So in JAX, to unbound a tensor, you use `jax.unbounded.Tensor(memory)`. So in the JAX code, when processing the memory, we
