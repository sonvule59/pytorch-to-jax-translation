JAX code output should only include JAX-specific code changes where necessary, 
using jnp for numpy arrays and jax for random number generation, and 
other JAX functions as needed. 
Output only code.

Okay, I need to convert the PyTorch code for the MemTestDataset into JAX equivalent. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the imports. In PyTorch, they import torch and Dataset. For JAX, the equivalent would be jax and jax.numpy as jnp, plus jax.random. So the imports change from using torch to jax modules.

The class MemTestDataset inherits from Dataset in both PyTorch and JAX. The constructor parameters are similar. In the PyTorch code, they use torch.manual_seed(seed), but in JAX, it's random.seed(seed). So that line needs to change.

The __len__ method is straightforward; in JAX, it returns self.n_samples as well, which is the same.

The __getitem__ method is the main part to change. In PyTorch, they generate inputs with torch.rand, which shifts and scales. In JAX, I'll use jnp.random.uniform for the same effect. The outputs are initialized with torch.zeros, which becomes jnp.zeros.

The loop in __getitem__: For each delay k, they concatenate a zero tensor of size k and the inputs, then shift. In PyTorch, inputs[:-k-1, :] means taking the part after k steps. In JAX, the same slicing applies to jnp arrays. So the code structure should stay similar, just using jnp functions.

Also, in PyTorch, the inputs are a tuple (inputs, outputs), which in JAX is the same. So the return statement remains.

Check if all PyTorch-specific functions are replaced with JAX equivalents. For example, torch.manual_seed becomes random.seed, and numpy functions like uniform replace torch.rand.

Make sure that JAX's random module is properly imported. The JAX code should use jnp for array operations and jax.random if needed, but in this case, uniform is sufficient.

So putting it all together, the JAX code should mirror the PyTorch code but use jnp for arrays, random.seed for initialization, and jax.numpy functions where necessary. No other changes needed since the logic is the same in JAX as long as the array operations are handled with jnp.
