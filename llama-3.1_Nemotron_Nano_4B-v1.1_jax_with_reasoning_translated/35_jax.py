But the user wants only the code output, no explanation. Also, the user provided a PyTorch code and wants the equivalent JAX code. However, the code provided by the user includes some custom elements like logging statements and a utility function. Since JAX doesn't have direct equivalents for PyTorch's logging modules, those lines would need to be adapted or removed. But the user's instruction says to output only code, no explanation.

But the user's original code has some parts that are PyTorch-specific, like using torch and mlperf_logging. The JAX code should replace those with JAX equivalents. However, mlperf_logging isn't part of standard JAX, so those log_event calls would need to be omitted or replaced if possible. But the user's instruction says to translate the Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code. So perhaps the logging lines should be removed or adapted to JAX's logging.

But the user's instruction says to output only code. So focusing on the parts that are JAX-compatible.

Looking at the original code:

The key part is the WarmupMultiStepLR class, which is a custom scheduler. The conversion of values uses perhaps_convert_float, which is a PyTorch-specific function. In the JAX code, this function is converted to a JAX-compatible function using vmap.maybe_some_math (though the name may vary).

The original code's WarmupMultiStepLR class in PyTorch is adapted to JAX, but some parts may not be directly translatable. For example, the get_lr method in PyTorch uses self.base_lrs, which are the learning rates. In JAX, the optimizer's learning rates are accessed via optimizer.lr.

But in JAX's _LRScheduler, the base_lrs are stored as an attribute, but when using JAX, the actual learning rates are in optimizer.lr. However, for compatibility with the PyTorch code's structure, perhaps we keep reference to base_lrs.

But in JAX, the base_lrs are initialized as a copy of the optimizer's parameters. So in the JAX code, the base_lrs can be accessed as self.base_lrs.

However, in the original code, during get_lr, the base_lrs are used. In JAX, this should still work.

But the
