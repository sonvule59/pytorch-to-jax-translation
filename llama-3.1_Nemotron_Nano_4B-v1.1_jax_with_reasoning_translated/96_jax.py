Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me look at each part step by step.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses `torch.tensor`, and JAX uses `jax.numpy` or `jax.numpy.tensor`. But in JAX, it's common to use `jax.numpy.float32` for tensors. Wait, the original code uses `dtype=torch.float`. So in JAX, I should replace that with `dtype=jax.numpy.float32` or just `dtype=float32`. But maybe the user expects using jax's tensor functions. Alternatively, since the code is to be translated, perhaps using `jax.numpy.tensor` with the right dtype.

Next, the test class. The test methods use `torch.tensor` and then operations. In JAX, the equivalent would be `jax.numpy.tensor` and `jax.numpy.sin`, etc. Also, the `PeriodicKernel` is a PyTorch-specific kernel, so I need to check if there's a JAX equivalent. Wait, the user's instruction is to translate the Python code written using PyTorch to JAX. But the PeriodicKernel is part of gpytorch, which is for PyTorch. However, the user might expect that the kernel is already available in JAX, or perhaps they want to use a similar approach. But since the user hasn't provided the JAX version of the kernel, maybe the answer assumes that the PeriodicKernel is replaced with a JAX-compatible method. Wait, but the original code uses PeriodicKernel from gpytorch. So perhaps the user expects that the code uses JAX's built-in functions and structures, replacing PyTorch's parts.

Wait, but the problem says to translate the Python code (using PyTorch) to equivalent JAX code. So the PeriodicKernel might not have a direct JAX equivalent. But the user's code uses it, so maybe the answer should use the same kernel but in JAX. However, that's not possible because gpytorch is PyTorch-only. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user is assuming that the PeriodicKernel is available in JAX, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. Wait, looking at the original code, the PeriodicKernel is initialized with lengthscale and period_length. The test computes a function involving sin and pow, then applies the kernel.

But since the user's instruction is to translate the code, perhaps the PeriodicKernel's implementation is not the focus here, and the main point is to replace PyTorch tensors with JAX ones and ensure that the operations use JAX functions. So, in the test methods, wherever there's a PyTorch tensor, replace it with jax.numpy.tensor or jax.numpy operations.

For example, in the first test method:

a is created as a tensor with view(3,1). In JAX, that would be jax.numpy.tensor(...).view(3,1). Similarly for b.

The actual computation uses math.pi, which is the same in both. The line `val = 2 * torch.pow(torch.sin(...), 2) / lengthscale` becomes `val = 2 * jax.numpy.pow(jax.numpy.sin(...), 2) / lengthscale`. But in JAX, operator overloading can be done with `.pow()`, but perhaps using jax.numpy functions is clearer.

Wait, but in JAX, you can use `@jax.vmap` or `jax.numpy` functions. So replacing torch with jax.numpy.

Also, the kernel initialization: in PyTorch, it's `PeriodicKernel().initialize(...)`. In JAX, if there's a similar kernel, but since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the kernel code is left as is, but the rest of the code uses JAX-compatible parts. However, that might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the kernel is available in JAX, but that's not the case. So perhaps the answer will have to use JAX's equivalent logic, but that's unclear. However, the user's instruction is to translate the code, so perhaps the kernel remains the same, but the rest of the code uses JAX.

Wait, but the code uses `PeriodicKernel` from gpytorch, which is PyTorch-specific. So in JAX, this kernel isn't available. Therefore, the code as written can't be directly translated. But the user's instruction says to output only the code, so maybe the answer assumes that the kernel is available in JAX, or perhaps the code is adjusted to use JAX's functions where possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different approach. Let me look at the code again.

In the test methods, the code creates tensors a and b
