Do not output anything if JAX is not installed.
JAX version: Do translate to JAX code if JAX is installed.

<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalent. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses `torch`, `torch.nn`, etc. JAX is similar but uses `jax`. However, in modern setups, JAX includes PyTorch support, so maybe some imports can be adjusted. But the user wants the code translated assuming JAX is installed. So replace PyTorch imports with JAX equivalents where possible.

The `argparse` module is standard, so that stays the same.

The `gym` environment is used, which is also available in JAX through `jax.env` but might need some adjustments. Wait, JAX has a `jax.env` that acts like a Gym environment. So instead of `gym.make`, use `jax.env`. But I need to check the exact syntax. Also, the environment methods like `reset`, `step`, etc., should be accessible via `env.reset()` in JAX.

Next, the `Policy` class. PyTorch's `nn.Module` is similar to JAX's `jax.nn.Module` or `jax.nn.ModuleDict` for state spaces. But in JAX, the linear layers are `jax.nn.Linear`. So the `Linear` layers in PyTorch should be `jax.nn.Linear`. Also, initialization: PyTorch uses `torch.nn.init` but JAX has its own initialization functions. However, the code as written initializes the layers implicitly, so maybe no changes there unless there's explicit initialization. The `relu` is the same, but in JAX, it's `jax.nn.relu`.

The forward method: In PyTorch, `F.relu` and `F.softmax` are used. In JAX, these have JAX equivalents: `jax.nn.relu` and `jax.nn.softmax`. Also, the `multinomial` function in PyTorch's `probs.multinomial` would be `jax.random.multinomial` in JAX.

The `select_action` function takes a state, converts it to a tensor, and calls `model(Variable(state))`. In JAX, variables are handled with `jax.various` or `jax.device.Variable`, but the syntax might be similar. However, since the state is a numpy array, converting it to a tensor in JAX would require `jax.numpy.tensor`. Then, passing it to the model's forward. The returned probs and state_value are already JAX tensors.

The `finish_episode` function has some gradient computations. PyTorch uses `torch.backward`, JAX uses `jax.grad.backward`. The `optimizer.step` in PyTorch has a JAX equivalent, but JAX uses `jax.optim.legacy.optimizers.step` if using legacy optimizers. However, the code uses `optim.Adam`, which is PyTorch. For JAX, the optimizer would be from `jax.optim`, like `jax.optim.legacy.optimizers.Adam` if using legacy, but JAX 3+ uses `jax.optim.core.optimizers.SGD`. Wait, the original code uses `optim.Adam`, but in JAX, the equivalent might be using `jax.optim.legacy.optimizers.Adam` if the user is on legacy. However, the user might be using JAX with its own API. Hmm, but the code provided uses `torch.optim`, so in JAX, the equivalent would be using `jax.optim` optimizers. However, the code might need adjustments for JAX's type handling.

Wait, the user's instruction says to output only code if JAX is installed. So the code should be translated assuming JAX is available. So replace all PyTorch-specific parts with JAX equivalents.

Looking at the `model` initialization: `nn.Linear` becomes `jax.nn.Linear`. The `SavedAction` namedtuple is the same in JAX.

In the `select_action` function, `probs = probs.multinomial()` becomes `probs, state_value = model(Variable(state))`, but the variable handling in JAX might require specifying the device. However, the original code uses `Variable` from PyTorch, which in JAX would be `jax.various.Variable` with the appropriate device. But the code might not need explicit device setup if the environment is handled correctly.

In the `finish_episode` function, the gradient computation uses `torch.backward`, which in JAX is `jax.grad.backward`. The `optimizer.step` in PyTorch would be `jax.optim.legacy.optimizers.step` if using legacy Adam, but JAX's optimizer interface is different. Wait, the original code uses `optim.Adam`, which is a PyTorch optimizer. In JAX, the equivalent would be using `jax.optim.core.optimizers.SGD` or `jax
