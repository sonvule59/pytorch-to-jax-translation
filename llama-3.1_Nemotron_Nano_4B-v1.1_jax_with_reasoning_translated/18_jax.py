**Note:** The above code is a direct translation but may not account for all differences in behavior between PyTorch and JAX. Further testing and adjustments may be necessary based on specific use cases. Additionally, JAX uses a different API, so some code structures might need modification to work seamlessly with JAX's autograd system.

However, strictly following the instructions, the code above replaces all PyTorch-specific imports/functions with their JAX equivalents.
