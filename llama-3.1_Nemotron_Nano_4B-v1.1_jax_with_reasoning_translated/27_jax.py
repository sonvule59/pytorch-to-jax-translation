Output-only code

<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses `torch`, but JAX uses `jax`. Also, some functions like `load_image` and `crop` aren't standard, so I'll assume they're defined elsewhere or adapted. The `from __future__` imports are Python 3.7+ features, which should still work in JAX.

The `Mscoco` class is a dataset. In JAX, classes still work, but I need to replace `torch` with `jax`. For example, `torch.Tensor` becomes `jax.numpy.Tensor`. Wait, but in JAX, it's common to use `jax.numpy` as the base, so maybe the code can be written using JAX's constructs.

Looking at the `__init__` method: `self.inp_res` and `self.out_res` are parameters. Those stay the same. The `load_image` function isn't shown, but assuming it's similar in both. The `_compute_mean` function calculates mean and std. In PyTorch, that's done with `mean()` and `std()`, but in JAX, those functions are available via `jax.numpy.mean` and `jax.numpy.std`.

Wait, in the original code, there's a part where they compute the mean and std of the training set. The code checks if the file exists and loads it; otherwise, computes manually. In JAX, maybe the same approach is used, but using JAX's functions. However, since JAX is asynchronous, but the code here is synchronous. But the user wants equivalent JAX code, so assuming it's running in a JAX VM with `jax.enable(autojit` and other settings.

In the `__getitem__` method: `load_image` is called. The rest involves creating inputs and ground truth. The `crop` and `color_normalize` functions aren't standard, so I'll have to assume they're adapted. The `pts` and `tpts` are tensors. The code uses `torch.Tensor`, which in JAX would be `jax.numpy.Tensor`.

The `draw_labelmap` function isn't provided here, but in the original code, it's part of the logic. Assuming that function is adapted to work with JAX tensors.

In the `coco` function, it's just returning an instance of Mscoco, so that's straightforward.

Now, replacing all PyTorch-specific parts with JAX equivalents. For example, `torch.Tensor` becomes `jax.numpy.Tensor`, but in JAX, it's common to use `jax.numpy.array` or `jax.numpy.device` etc. However, the code structure might not change much except for the import of `torch` to `jax`.

Wait, but in the original code, functions like `load_image` and `crop` are not JAX functions. So perhaps the user expects that these helper functions are already adapted, or that the code uses JAX's equivalents. But since the user wants the translation of the Python code as written, I should keep the function names but replace `torch` with `jax`.

Wait, but in the original code, `load_image` is a hypothetical function. So in the JAX version, it's the same function but perhaps using JAX's numpy. But since the user hasn't provided that code, I'll assume that the helper functions are compatible or already adapted.

So, step by step:

1. Replace all `torch` imports with `jax` equivalents. But in the given code, the imports are standard (like numpy, json, etc.), so those stay the same.

2. In the `Mscoco` class's `_compute_mean`, when calculating mean and std, use `jax.numpy.mean` and `jax.numpy.std` instead of `torch.Tensor.mean` and `.std()`. Wait, but in the original code, they compute the mean and std manually if the file isn't present. So in JAX, the code would be similar, using numpy operations.

Wait, the original code does:

mean += img.view(...).mean(1)
std += img.view(...).std(1)

But in JAX, using `jax.numpy.mean` and `jax.numpy.std` functions. However, the code here is in a Python class, and the code is synchronous. So perhaps the code remains the same, but using JAX's numpy backend.

But the user wants the equivalent JAX code. So the code structure remains the same, but using JAX's functions where possible. However, functions like `torch.utils.data.Dataset` are the same in JAX, so the class definition doesn't change much.

Looking at the `__getitem__` method: when creating `inp`, they use `crop` function. Assuming that in JAX, this
