But the user's original code has a PyTorch model class MyModel, and they want the equivalent JAX code. However, the example code they provided includes a rand_int function and some other imports, which might not be necessary. The main task is to translate the PyTorch code (specifically the MyModel class) to JAX.

But the user's instruction is to output only the code, using step-by-step reasoning, no explanations or markdown. So focusing on the MyModel class translation.

In PyTorch, the MyModel class uses nn.Linear. In JAX, the equivalent is jax-linear. Also, the forward method should use the JAX operations.

But in JAX, when using jit, the functions inside the model need to be compiled with jit. So the forward function should be a jit function.

But in the example code provided by the user, they tried to create a model using jax_module, which might not be the standard way. Typically, in JAX, you define a function that takes inputs and returns outputs, using jax.jit.

So the correct approach would be:

Define the model as a function that uses jax-linear layers and is compiled with jit.

But the user's code example has a MyModel class defined with @jax.jit decorated function. However, in JAX, it's common to define models as jit-compiled functions rather than classes.

So the equivalent JAX code for MyModel would be:

import jax
from jax import vmap
from jax.nn import Linear as jax_lin

@jax.jit
def my_model_jax(x_jax):
    return jax_lin(1)(x_jax)

But more accurately, the model should take inputs and apply the forward pass. So:

But in JAX, the model is typically a function that takes variables and returns variables. So the equivalent would be:

def my_model(x_jax):
    return jax_lin(1)(x_jax)

But with JIT compilation.

But the user's original code example tried to create a module-like structure. However, in JAX, it's more common to define functions.

But the user's code example has:

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(3, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.linear(x)
        return out

Translating this to JAX:

In JAX, you don't have a similar module class. Instead, you define a function that takes inputs and returns outputs.

So the JAX equivalent would be a function decorated with @jax.jit, which applies the linear layer.

But the input x in PyTorch is a tensor, in JAX it's a variable or array.

So the code would be:

@jax.jit
def my_model_jax(x_jax):
    return jax_lin(1)(x_jax)

But to make it more like a module, perhaps using a struct or a list of functions. But in JAX, the standard way is to define a function.

But the user's example code tried to create a model using jax_module, which might be part of their specific setup
