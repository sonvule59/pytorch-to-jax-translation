	# For ResNet, input to first layer is 3 (H, W, C), same as PyTorch

	# For forward pass, JAX's ResNet expects input with channels summed?
	# Need to adjust accordingly.

	# Alternative approach: use jax.compact_conv2d for PyTorch-style sparse conv

			# Similarly for layer2, layer3, layer4 with increasing stride and planes
			# After layer4, do avg pooling and linear layer

	# However, JAX requires all inputs to be jnp arrays, and functions are JIT compiled.

	# Note: JAX's batch norm is similar to PyTorch's, but needs to be JIT compiled.

	# Therefore, the code needs to JIT compile the model.

	# Also, JAX's reshape and view may be needed for avg pool.

	# But given the complexity, the code may need to be adapted carefully.

	# For the purpose of this question, the answer should directly translate the PyTorch code to JAX, using JAX equivalents.

	# So, translating each PyTorch layer to JAX equivalent.

	# BasicBlock in JAX:
	# Use jax.conv2d and jax.batch_norm.

	# However, JAX's nn.Module is not directly used; instead, build the model with jax.compact_conv2d where possible.

	# Given the complexity, here's a direct translation attempt:

	# ResNet JAX code:
