to translate to JAX:

But the code provided has some issues. For example, the line `total_loss = dec_fold.apply(decoder, [dec_fold_nodes, kld_fold_nodes])` may not be correct. The `apply` method expects a single input tensor, not a list of tensors. Also, the code uses PyTorch's `torch.sum` and other operations that are not JAX-compatible. Furthermore, the FoldExt and other PyTorch-specific classes need to be replaced with JAX equivalents or alternatives.

However, the user requested to output only the JAX code equivalent, assuming that the original code is as close as possible. But given the complexities and potential inaccuracies in the original code, the JAX code may not be fully accurate. Nonetheless, based on the structure and operations, here is the JAX code:
