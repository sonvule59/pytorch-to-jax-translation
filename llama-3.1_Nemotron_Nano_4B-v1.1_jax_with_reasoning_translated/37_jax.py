# Output only code. Use JAX equivalents.
# Replace PyTorch with JAX constructs where possible.

# Step 1: Replace PyTAX Data LoadERS with JAX DATA LOADER
# JAX has jax.data.Dataset and jax.numpy functions.

# In[ ]:
# JAX_DATA_LOADER = jax.data.loader(
#     dataset=mnist, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, drop_last=True
# )

# Step 2: REPLACE ALL PYTORCH MODULES WITH JAX EQUIVALENTS
# JAX uses jax.nn.Module, jax.nn.Linear, etc.

# In[ ]:
# In[3]: import torch --> import jax
# In[3]: torch.nn as nn --> import jax.nn as jaxnn
# In[4]: numpy as np --> import jax.numpy as jnp
# etc. for all imports.

# However, since the original code uses torchvision datasets, which is pytorch-specific, we need to replace dataset loading with JAX's equivalent.

# JAX does not have a built-in MNIST dataset, so we can use jax.numpy.datasets.MNIST.

# In[ ]:
# In[12]: mnist = datasets.MNIST(...) --> mnist = jnp.datasets.mnist.load_jax_data(...)

# Step 3: REPLACE ALL TO ONEHOT FUNCTIONS WITH JAX EQUIVALENTS
# JAX has jax.nn.MultiClassCrossEntropyLoss which can handle labels with class indices.

# In[ ]:
# In[6]: to_onehot --> jax.nn.MultiClassCrossEntropyLoss

# In[ ]:
# In[7]: get_sample_image --> Rewrite using JAX array operations.

# However, the original code uses BCELoss for binary classification. Since MNIST is 10 classes, we need to use MultiClassCrossEntropyLoss.

# Step 4: REPLACE CRITION WITH JAX EQUIVALENT
# In[ ]:
# In[15]: criterion = nn.BCELoss() --> from jax import jnp.nn.functional as jf, jax.nn.functional as jf2
# But BCELoss for multi-class: jax.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits
# However, the Discriminator outputs a probability for each class, so BCELoss may not be appropriate. Instead, use CrossEntropyLoss.

# In[ ]:
# In[15]: criterion = nn.BCELoss() --> from jax import jnp.array as jnp, jax.numpy as jnp
# But the labels are one-hot encoded. So BCELoss is appropriate.

# However, in JAX, the loss functions are different. Let's use jax.numpy.losses.BCELoss.

# Step 5: REPLACE ALL TORCH OPTIMIZERS WITH JAX OPTIMIZERS
# JAX has jax.optim.Optimizer.

# In[ ]:
# In[15]: D_opt = torch.optim.Adam(...) --> D_opt = jax.optim.adam(D.parameters(), **optimizer_args)

# But in JAX, the training loop is different. We need to use jax.train().

# The original code uses a for loop for training, but in JAX, we should use jax.train().

# So the training loop needs to be rewritten.

# However, the user's instruction is to translate the code as is, but with JAX equivalents. But given that the original code uses a custom training loop, it's challenging.

# Given the complexity, perhaps the user wants a code translation using JAX's syntax, even if the training loop is different.

# However, the user's instruction says: "translate Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code". So the code should be as close as possible, using JAX's equivalents.

# Therefore, the code will have to be adapted to use JAX's data loaders, modules, optimizers, and training loop.

# However, the original code's data loading part is in PyTorch, which is not directly translatable.

# Given the complexity, perhaps the answer should focus on the code parts that are not dataset-related and replace them with JAX equivalents.

# But the user's code includes dataset loading, which is tricky.

# Given the time constraints, perhaps the answer will replace the parts that can be translated and leave the dataset part as a placeholder.

# However, the user's code has a lot of PyTorch-specific code. Translating all of it to JAX is complex.

# Given the instructions, the assistant should output only the JAX code equivalent, replacing PyTorch with JAX where possible.

# However, the code provided in the question is quite extensive. To comply with the user's request, the assistant must output only the JAX code, replacing all PyTorch parts.

# But given the complexity, perhaps the assistant will provide
