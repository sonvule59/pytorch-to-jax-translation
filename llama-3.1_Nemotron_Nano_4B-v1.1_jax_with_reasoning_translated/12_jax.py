The user wants the PyTorch code converted to JAX, outputting only code.

So the answer should be the JAX equivalent code, replacing torch with jax, variables, gradients handled via JAX.

But need to ensure that the code uses JAX constructs. For example, in JAX, variables are created with jax.numpy.Variable, and the functions are defined with @jax.jit. However, the user's code uses a custom NNDModule which is presumably compatible with both. So the main changes are replacing torch with jax, using jax.numpy.Variable, and ensuring that the data is on the correct device (jax.device loc).

But JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent of torch.device, so in JAX, you can specify jax.device('cuda') or 'cpu'.

But in the original code, the user first uses cpu (torch) then cuda. In JAX, the loc can be set via jax.device.

But when creating variables, in JAX, you can use jax.numpy.Variable and specify the loc.

So the JAX code would look like:

import jax
import jax.nn as jnn
from jax.nn import Functional
from jax import device, comp
from modules.nnd import NNDModuleJAX  # Assuming a JAX compatible module

# Define the NNDModuleJAX if not already defined
class NNDModuleJAX(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dist = NNDModuleJAX.dist  # Assuming a matching JAX structure

    @jax.jit
    def dist(self, points1, points2):
        # Assuming the dist function is defined similarly to the PyTorch version
        # However, without the actual implementation, we can't replicate the computation here.
        # So, this is a placeholder. The actual dist function would need to be JAX compatible.
        pass

dist = NNDModuleJAX()

# Create JAX arrays (or variables)
p1 = jax.numpy.random.rand(10, 1000, 3)
p2 = jax.numpy.random.rand(10, 1500, 3)

points1 = jax.numpy.Variable(p1, location=device('cpu'))  # or 'cuda' if available
points2 = jax.numpy.Variable(p2)

# Compute distances (assuming dist is a JAX function)
dist1, dist2 = dist(points1, points2)

total_loss = comp.sum(dist1)
print(total_loss)

# Backpropagation is automatic in JAX; gradients are computed without.backward()
# However, to access gradients, since JAX uses just-in-time, we need to track them manually or use jit.

# However, in the original code, they do loss.backward() which in JAX would need to be handled via jit.

# But the user's code uses loss.backward(), which in JAX would require compiling the forward pass with jit and tracking gradients.

# However, the user's code expects to print the gradients after backward. In JAX, gradients are automatically computed, but accessing them requires that the forward pass is compiled with jit and that the variables are tracked.

# So, in JAX, after defining the model and composing the forward pass, gradients can be accessed via model.gradints or similar, but this depends on the setup.

# However, the original code uses a custom dist function. Assuming that the dist function is already compatible with JAX and uses jit appropriately.

# For the code provided, the JAX equivalent would replace torch with jax, use jax.numpy.Variable, and ensure that the computation is done with jit.

# However, the user's code has a custom NNDModule. In JAX, the equivalent would be a JAX-compatible module. But since the user's code uses a custom dist function, which is not provided, we have to assume that the dist function is already JAX compatible.

# Therefore, the JAX code would look like:

import jax
import jax.nn as jnn
from jax import device, comp

# Assuming the custom NNDModule is adapted for JAX
class NNDModuleJAX(jnn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dist = NNDModuleJAX.dist  # Placeholder for the dist function

    @jax.jit
    def dist(self, points1, points2):
        # Actual implementation would go here
        pass

dist = NNDModuleJAX()

p1 = jax.numpy.random.rand(10, 1000, 3)
p2 = jax.numpy.random.rand(10, 1500, 3)

points1 = jax
