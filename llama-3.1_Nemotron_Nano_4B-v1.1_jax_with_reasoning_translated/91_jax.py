Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by understanding each component.

First, the models. PyTorch uses nn.Module and Sequential. JAX uses jax.numpy and jax.jit. The Net class in PyTorch is a Sequential of layers. In JAX, I'll define a jax.jit.jit_class with the same structure. But wait, JAX compiles functions, so maybe I should use jax.jit.compile_module. Also, JAX doesn't have built-in Conv2d, so I'll need to use jax.nn.conv2d from jax.nn. Similarly for other layers like MaxPool2d and Dropout.

The Flatten module is straightforward; in JAX, it's just reshaping the tensor. The activation functions like ReLU and LogSoftmax need to be from jax.nn. For example, jax.nn.relu instead of torch.nn.ReLU(). But wait, in JAX, when using jit, the functions are compiled, so I have to make sure they're compatible.

The optimizer in PyTorch is AdamW. JAX has its own optimizers, like jax.optim.AdamW, so I should replace torch.optim.AdamW with jax.optim.AdamW. Also, the learning rate is the same, but in JAX, parameters are managed differently.

Data loading: PyTorch's DataLoader uses PyTorch tensors. JAX has jax.data.Dataset and jax.data.DataLoader. So I need to rewrite the data loaders using JAX's equivalents. The MNIST dataset in PyTorch uses torchvision datasets; in JAX, I'll create a custom dataset that loads the images and applies the transform.

The training and testing loops. In PyTorch, they use batches and iterate over DataLoader. In JAX, the training loop would use jax.data.Dataset and jax.random.JitRandom for data loading. Also, JAX uses jax.jit.map for functions that need compilation. But since the model is already compiled with jit, maybe the forward pass can be called without mapping. Wait, the model's forward is compiled, so when we call model(data), it's already compiled. But in JAX, the training loop might need to use jax.jit.map for the forward pass if it's not precompiled. Hmm, maybe I need to compile the model's forward function.

Wait, in the original code, the Net model's __call__ method is handled by the Sequential, which is composed of functions. In JAX, when using jit, each layer's forward method should be compiled. So I need to define each layer's forward as a jitscriptable function. Alternatively, wrap the PyTorch model in a jax.jit.compile_module and use jax.jit.map. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the model is built with JAX's layers, maybe it's better to construct the model using jax's modules directly.

Let me think. The original model has Conv2d, ReLU, etc. So in JAX, replace each PyTorch layer with the corresponding JAX layer. For example:

- nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1) becomes jax.nn.conv2d
- nn.ReLU() becomes jax.nn.relu
- nn.MaxPool2d(2) becomes jax.nn.max_pool2d(2)
- Flatten() becomes lambda x: x.view(-1)
- The Linear layers also need to be JAX's jnp.linalg.linear_map or jax.nn.linear

Wait, but JAX's nn.Linear is different. Also, the Softmax might need to be handled with jax.nn.softmax.

But the original code uses F.log_softmax(dim=1). In JAX, that's jax.nn.softmax with the appropriate parameters.

Also, the data transformation: in PyTorch, transforms are applied to the dataset. In JAX, the Dataset class can have a __getitem__ method that applies the transform. So I need to create a JAX dataset that loads the image and applies ToTensor and Normalize.

The DataLoader in JAX is jax.data.DataLoader, which takes a dataset and other parameters. Shuffle can be handled with jax.random.JitRandom.

The training loop in PyTorch uses optimizer.zero_grad() and loss.backward(). In JAX, since everything is on the GPU, the gradients are handled automatically. But JAX uses jit for automatic differentiation, so the training loop doesn't need to call.backward() explicitly. Wait, no. In JAX, when using jax.grad, you have to manually call gradf and then step. But when using jax.jit.train_loop,
