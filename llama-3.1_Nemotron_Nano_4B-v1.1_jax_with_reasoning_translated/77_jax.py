Here is the JAX code equivalent. 

<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me go through each test method one by one.

Starting with the 'cat' test. In PyTorch, they use MaskedTorch.cat. JAX uses jax.numpy.cat, but since we're dealing with masked tensors, maybe JAX has a similar masked version. Wait, the original code uses MaskedTorch.cat. In JAX, perhaps the equivalent is using jax.tensor.stack or jax.numpy functions with masking. But the user's code uses a custom MaskedTorch for concatenation. Hmm, but the task is to translate the code as-is. Wait, the original code uses MaskedTorch.cat, which is a PyTorch-specific class. JAX doesn't have MaskedTorch, so maybe the approach is different. Wait, the user's code might be using these classes for handling masked outputs. So perhaps in JAX, we need to replicate the same operations using JAX's constructs, maintaining the masking behavior.

Wait, the original code's MaskedTensor probably has a'mask' attribute indicating which elements are visible. When concatenating, the code stacks the tensors. In JAX, the equivalent might involve using jax.numpy functions with a mask, but since the user wants equivalent code, maybe the JAX code would use jax.tensor.stack but with the tensors being masked. However, the exact implementation might differ. But the user's instruction is to translate the Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code, so perhaps the JAX code would use similar function calls but with JAX's equivalents.

Wait, looking at the original code:

For test_cat, they create tensor1 and tensor2 as MaskedTensor instances, then use MaskedTorch.cat. In JAX, the equivalent might be using jax.numpy.cat but with masked tensors. However, JAX doesn't have a built-in MaskedTorch. So perhaps the approach is to use jax.tensor.stack or jax.numpy functions, but how to handle the masking? Alternatively, maybe the JAX code would use jax.numpy functions with a mask array. But the original code's masking is handled via the MaskedTensor's mask attribute. So perhaps in JAX, the code would create tensors with masks and then perform the operations, applying the masks appropriately.

But the user's code uses specific classes (MaskedTensor, MaskedTorch) which are PyTorch-specific. So in JAX, these classes don't exist. Therefore, the translation would need to use JAX's equivalents. However, the user's instruction is to output the equivalent JAX code, assuming that the same structure is used. Wait, but JAX doesn't have those classes. So maybe the answer is to replace PyTorch functions with JAX equivalents. For example, MaskedTorch becomes jax.numpymasked.Tensor or similar. But JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the code would use jax.tensor.stack and jax.numpy functions, handling the mask as part of the tensor.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the JAX code uses jax.numpy and jax.tensor functions, replicating the same logic. Let's look at each part.

In test_cat:

tensor1 = MaskedTensor(torch.tensor([1,2]))
tensor2 = MaskedTensor(torch.tensor([3,4]))
stack = MaskedTorch.cat([tensor1, tensor2], dim=0)
res = MaskedTensor(torch.tensor([[1,2,3,4]]))

In JAX, the equivalent would be creating tensors with masks, then using jax.numpy.cat, but applying the mask. However, JAX's approach to handling masked tensors is different. Alternatively, perhaps the code would use jax.tensor.stack and jax.numpy functions with masking.

But since the user wants the equivalent code, perhaps the JAX code would use jax.numpy.cat but with the tensors being masked. However, without the MaskedTorch class, the code structure would differ. But the user's answer is to output code that is equivalent in functionality. So perhaps the JAX code would create tensors with masks and then perform the operations, applying the mask where needed.

Wait, but the original code's MaskedTensor probably has a'mask' attribute that is a boolean array indicating which elements are visible. When concatenating, the code stacks the tensors, and the mask is handled implicitly. So in JAX, the equivalent might involve creating tensors with masks and then using jax.numpy functions with masking.

Alternatively, perhaps the JAX code would use jax.tensor.stack and jax.numpy functions, but the masking is handled via the mask attribute. However, the code would need to be adjusted to work with JAX's ecosystem.

But the user's instruction is to output the code that is equivalent. Let's think
