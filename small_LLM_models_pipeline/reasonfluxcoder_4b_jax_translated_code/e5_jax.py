# Wait, but the JAX code is not correct. The DNNModel class in JAX is not properly initialized with parameters. The weights and biases are hard-coded, which is not the way to do it in JAX. Also, the model is not using the parameters correctly. So, the JAX code is not correct. Let me fix that.

# The correct way to implement a neural network in JAX is to use the `nn` module, which is not part of the standard JAX library. Instead, we can use the `flax` library, which is a JAX-based library for neural networks. However, since the user is asking for a JAX implementation without using Flax, I need to implement the neural network manually.

# In the original PyTorch code, the model is defined with layers and parameters that are learned during training. In JAX, we need to define the model with parameters that are updated during training. This can be done by using the `@jax.jit` decorator for the forward pass and using the `optax` optimizer to update the parameters.

# So, the correct approach is to define the model with parameters, and then use the `optax` optimizer to update the parameters during training. The model should be defined with a function that takes the parameters and the input and returns the output.

# Let me rewrite the JAX code accordingly.

# First, I need to define the model with parameters. In JAX, we can define the model as a function that takes the parameters and the input and returns the output. The parameters can be stored in a dictionary or a tuple.

# In the original PyTorch code, the model has two linear layers. In JAX, we can define the model with the weights and biases for each layer. The weights and biases can be initialized using the `random` module.

# So, the correct JAX code should:

# 1. Define the model with parameters (weights and biases).
# 2. Use the `optax` optimizer to update the parameters.
# 3. Use `jax.jit` to speed up the training loop.
# 4. Use `jax.vmap` for vectorization if needed.

# Let me implement this correctly now.
# Okay, I need to correct the JAX code to properly implement the neural network with learnable parameters. The previous code had hardcoded weights, which is not correct. Let me adjust that.

# First, I'll define the model with parameters. In JAX, I can use the `random` module to initialize the weights and biases. Then, I'll define the model as a function that takes the parameters and input and returns the output.

# I'll also need to use `optax` for the optimizer and `jax.jit` to speed up the training loop.

# Let me rewrite the code accordingly.
# Okay, I need to make sure that the JAX code correctly initializes the model parameters and uses them during training. The previous code had hardcoded weights, which is not correct. Let me adjust that.
