# Wait, but in the JAX code, the model is not using the key in the forward pass. Also, the model is not using the key in the __call__ method. Let me check the code again.

# In the JAX code, the model is defined as a class with __call__ method that takes x and key. But in the training loop, when we call model(X, key), it's passing the key. However, in the JAX code, the model is not using the key in the forward pass. The key is not used in the model's forward pass. That's a problem. The key is not used in the model's forward pass. So the model is not using the key in the forward pass. That's a mistake. So the model should not take the key as an argument. The key is only used for the random number generation in the training loop. But in the current code, the model is not using the key in the forward pass.
