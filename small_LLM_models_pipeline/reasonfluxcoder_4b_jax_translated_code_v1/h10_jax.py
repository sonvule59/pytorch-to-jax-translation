# Wait, but in JAX, the model is not implemented as a class with hooks. The original PyTorch code uses hooks on a specific layer. How can we replicate this in JAX?

# The JAX code above is not correct because it's using a placeholder model that doesn't support hooks. So, the correct approach would be to implement the ResNet-18 model with hooks, but that's not trivial. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we need to provide a JAX code that is equivalent to the PyTorch code, even if it's not a full implementation of ResNet-18.

# So, the JAX code should be similar to the PyTorch code, but with JAX-specific functions and data structures. The key is to replicate the behavior of the hooks and the forward/backward passes.

# In JAX, we can use the `jax.lax.scan` function to implement the forward pass of the model, and we can use `jax.grad` to compute gradients. However, the hooks for capturing activations and gradients are not directly available in JAX as in PyTorch. Therefore, we need to find a way to capture the activations and gradients during the forward and backward passes.

# One approach is to modify the model to return the activations at the target layer, and then compute the gradients using `jax.grad`. However, this would require a different approach to the model implementation.

# In the JAX code provided earlier, the model is a placeholder, and the hooks are not implemented. Therefore, the code is not correct. To make it correct, we need to implement the model with hooks, which is not trivial.
