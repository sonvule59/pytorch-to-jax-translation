# Wait, but in the JAX code, the model is not implemented with a class, but with a function. Also, the model is not using the same structure as the PyTorch code. Let me check again.

# The PyTorch code defines a model class with a custom activation function. In JAX, the model is implemented as a class with parameters, but the forward pass is implemented as a function. The JAX code uses the `CustomActivationModel` class with `w` and `b` as parameters, and the forward pass is implemented in the `forward` method.

# The JAX code also uses `jaxopt.SGD` for optimization, which is different from PyTorch's `optim.SGD`. The training loop is implemented with `opt_update` and `opt_state`, which is a JAX-style optimization loop.

# The JAX code also uses `jax.numpy` for numerical operations, which is similar to PyTorch's `torch.tensor`, but with different syntax.
