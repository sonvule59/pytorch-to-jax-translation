# Wait, but in the JAX code, the loss function is not implemented correctly. The original PyTorch code uses CrossEntropyLoss, which is equivalent to log_softmax + nll_loss. However, in the JAX code, the loss is computed as a sum of log probabilities for the correct class, which is not correct. Let's fix that.

# The correct way to compute the loss is to use the log_softmax of the logits and then compute the negative log likelihood of the true labels. So the loss function should be:

def loss_fn(model, x, y):
    logits = model(x, key)

    # Compute negative log likelihood
