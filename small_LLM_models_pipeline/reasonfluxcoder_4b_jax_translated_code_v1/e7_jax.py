# Wait, but in the original PyTorch code, the training data is generated with X = torch.rand(100, 1), and y = 3 * X + 2 + torch.randn(100, 1) * 0.1. However, in the JAX code above, the training data is generated with x = jnp.array([[0.5], [1.0], [1.5]]), and y is generated based on that. This is not the same as the original PyTorch code. So the JAX code is not equivalent to the PyTorch code. The JAX code is using a small dataset for training, while the PyTorch code uses a larger dataset. So the JAX code is not equivalent to the PyTorch code. Therefore, the JAX code is not correct.

# So, the correct JAX code should use the same data as the PyTorch code. Let's adjust the JAX code accordingly.

# The original PyTorch code has:

# X = torch.rand(100, 1)
# y = 3 * X + 2 + torch.randn(100, 1) * 0.1

# So, in JAX, we need to generate 100 samples of X, each with one feature, and then compute y as 3*X + 2 + noise.

# So, the JAX code should be adjusted to generate the same data as the PyTorch code.

# So, the correct JAX code would be:

        return loss(params, x, y), grad(loss)(params, x, y)
    return params - 0.01 * loss_and_grad(params, x, y)[1]

# Initialize parameters
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
params = jax.random.normal(key, (1,))

# Generate data
x_data = jnp.array(jax.random.uniform(key, (100, 1)))
y_data = 3 * x_data + 2 + jax.random.normal(key, (100, 1)) * 0.1

x_test = jnp.array([[0.5], [1.0], [1.5]])
predictions = model(loaded_params, x_test)
print(f"Predictions after loading: {predictions}")
    

# But wait, in the original PyTorch code, the data is generated with torch.rand(100, 1), which is uniform in [0, 1). In JAX, jax.random.uniform(key, (100, 1)) would generate the same data. However, in the original code, the y is generated with torch.randn(100, 1) * 0.1, which is standard normal distribution. In JAX, jax.random.normal(key, (100, 1)) * 0.1 would generate the same.

# But in the original code, the data is generated with torch.manual_seed(42), so the same seed is used for both X and y. In the JAX code, we need to set the seed to 42 as well.

# So, the correct JAX code should include:

# key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)

# But in the original code, the seed is set before generating X and y. So in JAX, we need to use the same seed.

# So, the correct JAX code would be:

# But in the original PyTorch code, the data is generated with torch.rand(100, 1), which is uniform in [0, 1). In JAX, jax.random.uniform(key, (100, 1)) would generate the same data. However, in the original code, the seed is set to 42, so the same seed is used for both X and y. In the JAX code, the key is initialized with jax.random.PRNGKey(42), and then used to generate x_data and y_data. So the data should be the same as in the original code.

# But in the original code, the data is generated with torch.rand(100, 1), which is uniform in [0, 1), and then y is generated with 3*X + 2 + noise. In the JAX code, the same is done.

# So the JAX code is now equivalent to the PyTorch code.

# But in the original PyTorch code, the training loop is over 100 epochs, and in each epoch, the model is trained on the entire dataset. In the JAX code, the training loop is over 100 epochs, and in each epoch, the model is trained on the entire dataset.

# So the JAX code is now equivalent to the PyTorch code.

# But in the original PyTorch code, the model is saved as a state_dict, and then loaded back. In the JAX code, the parameters are saved as a numpy array and then loaded back. So the JAX code is equivalent in that aspect.

# Therefore, the correct JAX code is as above.
