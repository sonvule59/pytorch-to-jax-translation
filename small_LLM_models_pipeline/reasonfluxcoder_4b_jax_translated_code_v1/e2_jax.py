# Wait, but in the original PyTorch code, the data is generated and saved to a CSV file, then loaded again. In the JAX code, the data is generated and saved, then loaded again. However, in the JAX code, the data is not being loaded from the CSV file in the same way as in the PyTorch code. The JAX code seems to have a problem with the data loading part. Let me check the original PyTorch code again.
