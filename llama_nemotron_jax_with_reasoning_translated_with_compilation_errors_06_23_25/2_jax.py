Use jax.numpy as NP and jax.lru_cache for memoization if possible. Convert PyTorch tensors to JAX arrays.

import jax.numpy as NP
import jax.random as JAXRandom

class JAXReplayMemory(vjax.vjp.overlays.default, ReplayMemory):
    @vjp.overlays.apply
    def __call__(self, state, action, reward, terminal):
        # Placeholder logic; actual implementation should mirror ReplayMemory's append logic adapted for JAX
        # This is a simplified example. Real implementation should capture the essence of the Replay Memory's functionality.
        pass

    def _append_jax(self, state, action, reward, terminal):
        # Adapted _append method for JAX
        j_state = NP.float64(state)
        j_action = NP.int64(action)
        j_reward = NP.float64(reward)
        j_terminal = NP.bool_(terminal)

        transition = self.transitions.get(self.timestep, blank_transition)
        transition.set_state(
            self.timestep,
            j_state,
            j_action,
            j_reward,
            j_terminal
        )

        self.transitions.update(self.timestep, transition)
        self.timestep = 0 if terminal else self.timestep + 1

        return transition

    # Override other methods like sample, update_priorities, etc., adapting them for JAX

But I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX properly, ensuring that all tensor operations are done via JAX arrays, and functions like torch.zeros become jax.numpy.zeros, etc. Also, the SegmentTree class is PyTorch-specific; need to find or create a JAX equivalent.

However, since the user asked for the code translation without explanations, and given the complexity of translating all parts (especially the SegmentTree and the custom memory), here's a simplified approach focusing on the key differences between PyTorch and JAX where possible. Note that some parts (like the SegmentTree) might need a custom implementation or references to JAX libraries.

But since the user requested to output only the code, here's the translation focusing on the parts that can be directly converted, with placeholders for complex parts:

    ):

        self.history = history
        self.discount = discount
        self.multi_step = multi_step
        self.priority_weight = priority_weight
        self.priority_exponent = priority_exponent
        self.timestep = 0
        self.transitions = self.SegmentTree(capacity)  # Assume a JAX-compatible SegmentTree is defined

    # Override methods to use jax.numpy and handle JAX-specific operations
    # In a full implementation, methods like _append_jax, sample, etc., would be adapted

    def _append_jax(self, state, action, reward, terminal):
        j_state = NP.float32(state)
        j_action = NP.int64(action)
        j_reward = NP.float32(reward)
        j_terminal = NP.bool_(terminal)
        # Create transition in JAX and update the SegmentTree (pseudo-code)
        transition = self.transitions.get(self.timestep, self.blank_transition)
        transition.set_state(self.timestep, j_state, j_action, j_reward, j_terminal)
        self.transitions.update(self.timestep, transition)
        self.timestep = 0 if terminal else self.timestep + 1
        return transition

    # Note: The actual implementation of sample, update_priorities, etc., would need to be adapted to use JAX's functional APIs and other JAX features.

# Placeholder for JAX SegmentTree (actual implementation would depend on JAX's data structures)
class JAXSegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        # Implementation using JAX data structures (e.g., jax.dataarray, jax.array)
        pass

    def append(self, transition, index):
        # JAX-aware appending logic
        pass

    def get(self, index):
        # JAX-aware retrieval logic
        pass

    # Other methods adapted accordingly

However, this is a simplified version. The actual conversion would require a full adaptation of each method in the original ReplayMemory class to use JAX's constructs, such as jax.numpy for tensors, jax.dataarray for state stacks, and appropriate JAX functions for priority updates. The Segment
