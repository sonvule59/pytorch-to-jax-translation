Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants to convert a PyTorch function to JAX. First, I need to understand the original code.

The PyTorch function 'your_func' takes an input 'x', creates an 'input_tensor', converts it to a JAX array 'input_jax', applies a CustomLayer, uses an activation function, and returns the result. The CustomLayer is a simple linear layer.

But wait, in PyTorch, 'x' is a tensor, so 'x variable' might be a typo. Maybe it's just 'x' without 'variable'. Also, PyTorch uses 'apply' method for custom layers, which is correct here.

Next, translating to JAX. JAX uses similar APIs. The input 'x' should be a JAX array. The line 'input_tensor = x variable' probably means 'input_tensor = x' since PyTjax converts tensors to JAX arrays when using JIT. But in the original code, they explicitly convert with jnp.array. However, in JAX, you don't need to cast like that if the input is already a JAX array.

The CustomLayer in PyTorch uses 'apply', which is compatible with JAX's 'apply' method. So the layer definition can stay similar.

The activation function 'jnp.activating_function' is PyTorch-specific. JAX has its own activation functions, like 'jax.activating'. So I should replace that with 'output_jax = jax.activating(output_jax)'.

Also, in JAX, functions are defined with @jax.jit to enable just-in-time compilation, but the user might want the JAX version without JIT for direct translation. However, the original code doesn't use JIT, so maybe just translate the functions.

Wait, the original code has 'from.core import *' and similar imports. The JAX code should include necessary imports, like 'import jax.vmap' if using vmap, but the original code doesn't, so maybe just the essentials.

The original code uses 'jnp.array' with 'jax.vjp_target=jax.vjp' which might be unnecessary. In JAX, when you pass a PyTorch tensor to JAX functions, you need to specify the target to PyTorch or JAX. But if the input is already a JAX array, this isn't needed. However, the example usage in the original code passes jax.vjp_target, which suggests they're converting a PyTorch tensor to JAX. But in the JAX version, the input should already be a JAX array.

So, assuming 'x' is a JAX array, 'input_jax' can be obtained directly. The line 'input_jax = jnp.array(input_tensor, jax.vjp_target=jax.vjp)' might be redundant. Instead, just use 'input_jax = x'.

The CustomLayer's 'apply' method is the same in JAX, so the class can remain mostly the same.

The activation function in JAX is 'jax.activating', so replace that line.

Also, in JAX, the function should be defined with JAX-specific syntax. Since the user wants equivalent JAX code, the function 'your_func' should take a JAX array as input.

Putting it all together:

- Remove the explicit jnp.array conversion since JAX expects JAX arrays.
- Use jax.activating instead of jnp.activating_function.
- Ensure the CustomLayer uses JAX-compatible methods (which it does with 'apply').
- Import necessary JAX modules, but the original code doesn't, so minimal imports.

So the translated code would look like:

import jax
from jax import numpy as jnp
from your_module import Custom
