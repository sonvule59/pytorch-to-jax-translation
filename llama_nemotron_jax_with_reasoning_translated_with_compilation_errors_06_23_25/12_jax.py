use JAX transforms for variable sharing and gradient accumulation. Use JAX primitives for operations. Replace PyTorch with JAX functions.

In the first part, the code defines a distance module (assumed to compute some distances between points), uses variables with requires_grad=True and False. Then computes loss as sum of dist1. Backward passes.

In JAX, variables can be shared across devices. Use jax.vmap for variable sharing. Replace torch.autograd.Variable with jax.array.FunctionBuilder.

For device independence, move variables to GPU with jax.vmap(jax.device_map()).split(' '). But in the example, variables are moved to CUDA manually. Alternatively, use jax.vmap to handle device placement.

However, in JAX, it's better to let jax handle device placement via jax.device_map(). So when creating variables, use jax.device_map to place them on the correct device.

But in the original code, the user first moves points1 to GPU with points1 = Variable(p1.cuda(),...). In JAX, this can be handled via jax.vmap.

But since the code uses separate Variable assignments for CPU and GPU, perhaps in JAX, we can create the variables once and let jax handle the device mapping.

But the user's code has two separate runs: one on CPU and one on GPU. In JAX, we can combine these by using jax.vmap to map the variables to different devices.

But the dist module is assumed to be JAX-compatible. So the main changes are:

- Replace torch with jax
- Use jax.vmap for variable sharing and device management
- Replace PyTorch variables with jax.array.FunctionBuilder
- Use jax.grad for automatic differentiation
- Use jax.sum instead of torch.sum

But the dist module (NNDModule) is assumed to be JAX-compatible. So the code would look like:

import jax
from modules.nnd import NNDModule

dist = NNDModule()

# Create variables with device mapping
points1 = jax.array_function_builder.from_tensor_slices((jax.random.uniform((10, 1000, 3), ()).split(' ')).flat())
points2 = jjax.array_function_builder.from_tensor_slices((jax.random.uniform((10, 1500, 3), ()).split(' ')).flat())

# Use jax.vmap to place variables on GPU if present
device_map = jax.device_map()
points1_gpu = jax.vmap(device_map)(points1)
points2_gpu = jax.vmap(device_map)(points2)

dist1, dist2 = dist(points1_gpu, points2_gpu)
loss = jax.sum(dist1)
loss.backward()
print(points1_gpu.grad, points2_gpu.grad)

Wait, but in the original code, points1 is created with torch.rand, which is uniform. In JAX, jax.random.uniform is used.

But the original code also has separate runs for CPU and GPU. To replicate that in JAX, perhaps create two sets of variables, one for CPU and one for GPU, but JAX automatically handles device placement based on where the code is run. However, using jax.vmap(device_map) would map the variables to the respective devices.

Alternatively, create the variables once, and then split into CPU and GPU. But JAX's automatic device handling may not exactly replicate the original code's structure.

But the user's code has two separate sections: one on CPU and one on GPU. In JAX, this can be handled by using jax.vmap to map the variables to different devices.

But perhaps the user wants the code to work in either CPU or GPU, not both at the same time. So the JAX code would create the variables, and then use jax.vmap to place them on the GPU if available.

But the original code runs once on CPU and once on GPU. In JAX, this would require running the code twice, which is not practical. So perhaps the JAX code should create the variables and then run the computation on both devices, but that's not typical. Instead, the JAX code would create the variables and let jax handle the device placement automatically.

But the user's code has explicit moves to CUDA. In JAX, this is handled via device_map. So the code can be rewritten to use jax's mechanisms.

Putting it all together, the JAX code would look like:

import jax
from modules.nnd import NNDModule

dist = NNDModule()

# Generate random points on CPU (default device)
points1_cpu = jax.random.uniform((10, 1000, 3), ())
points2_cpu = jax.random.uniform((10, 1500, 3), ())

# Split into device-specific variables
points1_gpu = jax.vmap(lambda x: jax.array(x, jax.device('/GPU' if x.device == 'CPU' else 'GPU')))(
