# Convert model to JAX-compatible (assuming pretrained weights are handled)
# Note: In practice, you'd need to load JAX models or use a different pretrained backbone

# JAX code
import jax
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax import vmap
from jax.nn import functional as jnnfunc
from jax import compactor

# Assuming the rest of the code is adapted for JAX, here's the translation:
# Model remains similar, but using JAX ops

# Replace all torch.nn.Module with jax.nn.Module
# Replace nn.Conv3d with jax.nn.conv3d (but note JAX's Conv3d is different)
# However, JAX doesn't have native Conv3d for 3D convolutions; use jax.nn.conv_transpose3d etc.

# The MedCNN class in JAX would use JAX's convolution layers
# Also, the forward method uses JAX's functions

# Since the original code uses PyTorch's Conv3d, which is not directly available in JAX,
# we need to use JAX's equivalent functions. However, JAX's Conv layers are designed for 2D convs,
# so for 3D convs, use transpose convs.

# Adjusting the MedCNN's forward method for JAX:

# Note: The original code's ResNet backbone may not be directly transferable to JAX.
# Hence, we might need to adjust the backbone or use JAX's pre-trained models.

# Given the complexity, here's a simplified translation focusing on structure:

class MedCNNjax(jax.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, backbone, out_channel=1):
        super(MedCNNjax, self).__init__()
        self.backbone = backbone
        # Define JAX convolution layers here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Use JAX functions for convolution, transpose, etc.
        # Example using JAX's view and ConvTranspose3d
        # Note: JAX's Conv layers require 4D tensors; adjust dimensions accordingly
        # The rest of the forward pass similar but with JAX ops

# However, to accurately translate the given PyTorch code to JAX, we need to replace all PyTorch layers with their JAX equivalents.

# Given the complexity and the instruction to output only valid JAX code, here's the translated code:

import jax
from jax import vmap, compactor
from jax.nn import functional as jnnfunc, Conv3d as jax_conv3d, ConvTranspose3d as jax_convtranspose3d

# Replace all instances of PyTorch's Conv3d with JAX's Conv3d (but note JAX's Conv3d is for 2D convs)
# However, JAX doesn't support 3D convs directly; use ConvTranspose3d for downsampling.

# The original MedCNN's Conv layers are 3D convolutions, which in JAX can be implemented with ConvTranspose3d by appropriately reshaping the input.

# Given the complexity, here's a simplified translation focusing on key parts:

# Assuming the backbone is adapted to JAX's capabilities (e.g., using JAX's ResNet)
# The MedCNNjax class using JAX's layers:

class MedCNNjax(jax.nn.Module):
    @compactor(vmap)
    def __init__(self, backbone, out_channel=1):
        super(MedCNNjax, self).__init__()
        self.backbone = backbone
        # Define JAX convolution layers here

    def forward(self, x):

        b, d, c, w, h = x.size()
        print(f"Input shape [B, D, C, W, H]: {b, d, c, w, h}")
        # Reshape for 3D convolution (using ConvTranspose3d)
        x = x.view(b*d, c, w, h)  # [B*D, C, W, H]
