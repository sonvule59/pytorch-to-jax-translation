Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the imports. The original uses torch and related modules. In JAX, I should replace torch with jax.jax. But wait, JAX doesn't use torch, so maybe just import jax and use jax.numpy for the arrays. However, the user might have set up a JAX configuration already, so maybe just import the necessary modules. But the original code has torch.manual_seed, which in JAX would be jax.random.seed or jax.numpy.random.seed. Let me check.

The data generation part: X is created with torch.rand, which in JAX would be jax.numpy.random.rand. Similarly, y uses torch.randn. Also, the model's forward method uses nn.Linear, which in JAX would be jax.nn.Linear. Oh right, JAX has its own modules, so I should use jax.nn.Linear instead of torch.nn.Linear.

The optimizer: In PyTorch, optim.Adam is used. In JAX, the equivalent is jax.optim.Adam. So the optimizer line would be jax.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01).

The training loop: The forward pass is model(X), which in JAX would be similar, but since JAX uses functional APIs, maybe the model's forward is already compatible. The loss calculation uses MSELoss, which in JAX is jax.nn.mse_loss. So the criterion would be jax.nn.mse_loss.

Also, the logging part: The print statement uses.item(), which in JAX functions, the outputs are already in JAX arrays, but when printed, they might show JAX tensors. However, the user probably just wants the code to be compatible, so the syntax remains the same.

Wait, in JAX, the data is handled with jax.numpy arrays, so X and y should be jax.numpy arrays. So replacing torch tensors with jax.numpy arrays. For example, X = jax.numpy.random.rand(100, 2) * 10. Similarly for y.

The model definition: The DNNModel uses nn.Linear, which becomes jax.nn.Linear. So in the __init__ method, self.fc1 = jax.nn.Linear(2, 10), etc.

The optimizer is initialized with jax.optim.Adam. The loss function is jax.nn.mse_loss, so criterion = jax.nn.mse_loss. Also, the MSELoss in PyTorch is replaced by JAX's mse_loss.

In the training loop, the forward pass is model(X), which should work as is if the model is a JAX-compatible module. The backward pass uses optimizer.zero_grad(), which is the same. The loss.backward() and optimizer.step() are the same syntax.

Testing part: X_test is a tensor, which in JAX is a jax.numpy array. The model's forward is called, and predictions are made. The print statement would output the JAX tensors, but the code structure remains the same.

So putting it all together:

Replace all torch imports with jax imports where necessary. Use jax.numpy for data creation. Use jax.nn for modules. Use jax.optim for the optimizer. Use jax.nn.mse_loss for the loss function.

Wait, but in JAX, the MSELoss is available via jax.nn.mse_loss, so the criterion line becomes criterion = jax.nn.mse_loss(predictions, y).

Also, the data generation uses torch.randn, which becomes jax.numpy.random.randn.

Another thing: In JAX, the random seed can be set using jax.random.seed(42) instead of torch.manual_seed. So the initial data generation would use jax.random.seed(42) instead of torch.manual_seed(42).

So the first line would be jax.random.seed(42), then X = jax.numpy.random.rand(100, 2) * 10.

Similarly for y: y = (X[:,0] + X[:,1]*2).unsqueeze(1) + jax.numpy.random.randn(100,1).

The model's forward method remains the same, but uses jax.nn.Linear.

The optimizer is jax.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01). Wait, in PyTorch, model.parameters() is a generator, same in JAX. So that's okay.

The loss is computed with jax.nn.mse_loss, which takes predictions and y as inputs.

In the training loop, the variables like loss.item() would not be needed because JAX functions return JAX scalars, and.item() is used when converting to Python scalars. But in JAX, when using jax.grad or other functions, the outputs are already JAX arrays. However, in the code
