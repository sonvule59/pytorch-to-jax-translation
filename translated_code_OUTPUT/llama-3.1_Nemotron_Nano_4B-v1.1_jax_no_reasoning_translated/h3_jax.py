Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by understanding what each part of the code does.

First, the code defines a TransformerModel class using PyTorch's nn modules. The forward method includes an embedding layer, transformer encoder layers, and a pooling step (mean dim 1) before the output layer. Then it generates some synthetic data, sets up the optimizer and loss function, trains for epochs, and tests.

In JAX, I can't use nn.Module directly. Instead, I'll define a jax.nn.Module and use jax.layers.TransformerEncoderLayer from jax. Also, JAX requires JIT compilation, so I need to compile the model with jax.compiled_forward.

The embedding layer in PyTorch is nn.Linear, which in JAX would be jax.layers.Linear. The transformer encoder layers are similar, but I need to make sure to use the correct JAX transformer layer.

The pooling step in PyTorch (x.mean(dim=1))) can be done using jax.nn.mean or jax.ops.elementwise_product combined with jax.nn.mean across dimensions. Wait, in JAX, the mean function can take axes parameter. So x.mean(dim=1) would be jax.nn.mean(x, axis=1).

The data loading part in PyTorch uses torch.manual_seed, which in JAX is jax.random.seed. The synthetic data X and y are created with torch.rand, which in JAX is jax.random.normal. But I need to adjust the dimensions. Also, in JAX, functions like jax.nn.Linear expect the input shape correctly. For example, X is (num_samples, seq_length, input_dim), so when creating the Linear layer for embedding, input_dim is the first dimension (num_samples), and output_dim is embed_dim.

The optimizer in PyTorch is optim.Adam, which in JAX can be replaced with jax.optim.adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001). Similarly, the loss function is MSELoss, which is available in jax.nn as jax.nn.MSELoss.

The training loop structure is similar, but in JAX, the forward pass needs to be compiled. So I should compile the model once with jax.compiled_forward. Also, during the training loop, I need to use jax.grad if necessary, but in this case, since the model is compiled, the forward pass should be optimized.

Wait, in JAX, when using the high-level API (like jax.run or jax.script), the functions are compiled, but in a training loop with gradients, using jax.grad might be necessary. However, when compiling the model with jax.compiled_forward, the forward pass is already optimized, and the backward pass uses the gradients. So the code should work as is, but with JAX-specific imports and compilation.

Also, the print statements in PyTorch won't work in JAX, but the user's example includes them. However, the user's instruction says to output only valid JAX code, so maybe the print statements can be left as is, but in practice, JAX doesn't support print in the high-level APIs. But since the user's code includes them, perhaps they want the same structure, even if it's not standard in JAX. Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the code converted, and the print statements are part of the original code that they want retained. So I'll include them as is.

Now, let's go step by step.

1. Replace PyTorch imports with JAX equivalents. For example, import jax instead of torch, and use jax.nn, jax.optim, etc.

Wait, but in JAX, you can still use PyTorch for some parts if you're using the PyTorch-JAX hybrid mode. However, the user wants the code converted to JAX, so probably all parts should be in pure JAX. But the original code uses functions like torch.manual_seed, which in JAX is jax.random.seed. So I'll replace all torch imports with jax imports.

Wait, the user's code includes both torch and jax? Or is the goal to have a JAX-only version? The user says "using PyTorch to JAX", so likely converting all torch parts to JAX.

So, first, replace all torch imports with jax. For example:

Original:
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

JAX version:
import jax
from jax import nn, layers, random, optim

But wait, in JAX, the standard is to use jax.nn.Module, jax.layers.TransformerEncoderLayer, etc. So the code should be rewritten using JAX's APIs.

2. The TransformerModel class:

In PyTorch, the encoder uses Transformer
