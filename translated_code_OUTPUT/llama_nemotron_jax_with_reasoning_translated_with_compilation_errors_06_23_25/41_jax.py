# Original code is in PyTorch. Need to convert to JAX.
# The original code defines a custom Trainer class inheriting from Registrable.
# The Trainer uses PyTorch's optimizers and schedulers, which need JAX equivalents.

# Key steps to convert:
# 1. Replace PyTorch with JAX: Use jax.numpy, jax.device, jax.lax
# 2. Replace torch.optim.lr_scheduler with jax.optim.lr_scheduler
# 3. Model serialization: JAX has jax.save and jax.load for serialization
# 4. Distributed training: JAX has jax.distributed for distributed training
# 5. Checkpoints: Use TrainerCheckpoint named tuple with jax.save/load

# However, the original code doesn't show the actual model training code, so the JAX version will be a skeleton.

# Assuming the Trainer's train method loads the model, optimizer, and data loader,
# then does forward and backward passes, optimizes, and saves checkpoints.

# Below is a minimal conversion of the Trainer class to JAX-compatible.

# Note: This is a simplified version. Actual implementation may vary based on the model.
