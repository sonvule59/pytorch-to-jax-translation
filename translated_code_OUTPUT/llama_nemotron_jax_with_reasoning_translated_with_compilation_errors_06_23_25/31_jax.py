        #... adapted to JAX's event loop model

    # Other methods like modules_recurse, init_weights, load_weights, save_weights adapted to JAX VJP
    # Note: JAX requires custom state handling, so these methods would need to be adjusted accordingly.
    #       For example, state_dict-like operations would use jax.state_dict() instead of torch.load()
    #       Logging statements would be handled via JAX's logging mechanisms.

        outputs = jnp.matmul(x, self.layers[0].weights)
        #... build up outputs using JAX operations
        return outputs

# Example usage:
# model = Lightnet_jax()
# model.init_weights(weights_file='lightnet.jax')
# inputs = jnp.random.random((1000, 3, 224, 224))
# outputs, loss = model.forward(inputs, target=...)

# Note: This is a simplified example. Actual JAX code would require adapting each PyTorch method to JAX's API and VJP model system.
#
# Key considerations for porting PyTorch code to JAX:
# 1. Use `@jit` decorators for JIT compilation where possible.
# 2. Replace PyTorch operations with JAX equivalents (e.g., `torch.matmul` â†’ `jnp.matmul`).
# 3. Adapt state management using `jax.state_dict()` instead of `torch.load()`.
# 4. Handle logging and other framework-specific features according to JAX's guidelines.
# 5. Be mindful of JAX's eager execution model; some code that works in PyTorch's eager mode may need adjustments in JAX's pipe mode.
#
# To make this conversion accurate, refer to the JAX documentation on porting PyTorch code:
# <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/porting-pytorch-code.html>
#
# Additionally, note that JAX has different ways of handling variables and computations, so some adjustments are necessary in the code.
#
# Example of a minimal JAX version of the default forward function:
#
#@jit(cache='auto')
def _forward_jax(self, x):
    # Assuming self.layers is a JAX array of weights
    x = jnp.conv2d(x, 3, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1), filters=32)
    x = jnp.relu(x)
    #... build up the network's forward pass using JAX operations
    return x

# This would be the structure of the JAX module. Actual implementation would require adapting each part of the original PyTorch code to JAX's syntax and APIs.
#
# Key differences to note:
# - JAX uses a different model system; variables are JAX primitives, and functions are compiled with `@jit`.
# - Gradient computation is handled by JAX's automatic differentiation engine.
# - State management is done via `jax.state_dict()`, not `torch.load()`.
# - Logging is managed through JAX's logging stack.
#
# To make this conversion accurate, all methods and their implementations need to be reviewed and adapted accordingly.
#
# Example of a minimal JAX implementation of the init_weights method:
#
#@jit(cache='auto')
