- The `@torch.jit.script` is deprecated in PyTorch; JAX uses `@jax.jit.compact` or `@jax.jit.ao` for compilation. However, since the user requested JAX code, replace PyTorch with JAX's PyTorch-compatible interface (e.g., `jax.numpy` for tensor operations). The function `calculate_torch` uses custom JIT compilation; for JAX code, functions should utilize JAX's JIT compilation. 

But since the user wants the JAX equivalent, here's the revised code using JAX primitives:

First, note that PyTorch and JAX have different tensor operations. Replace `torch.Tensor` with `jax.numpy.ndarray` and adjust operations accordingly. Also, JIT compilation in JAX uses `@jax.jit.jit` or `@jax.jit.aoc` for AO (autograd) mode.

However, the original code's `calculate_torsions` has autograd via PyTorch's autograd. In JAX, autograd is handled via differentiable arrays. So, translating line by line:

`p0 - p1` becomes `jax.numpy.sub(a, b)`, but subtraction is the same. 

But given the complexity, here's a direct translation attempt:

import jax
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax import jit

@jit.jit
def calculate_distances_jax(p0: jnp.ndarray, p1: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
    Dij = jnp.sqrt(jnp.sum(jnp.relu(jnp.square(jnp.sub(p0, p1))).axis(-1), -1))
    return Dij

def calculate_torsions_jax(p0: jnp.ndarray, p1: jnp.ndarray, p2: jnp.ndarray, p3: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
    b0 = -1.0 * (p1 - p0)
    b1 = p2 - p1
    b2 = p3 - p2

    if p0.dim() == 1:
        b1_normalized = jnp.divide(b1, jnp.norm(b1))
    else:
        norms = jnp.norm(b1, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        b1_normalized = jnp.divide(b1, norms[:, None])

    v = b0 - jnp.sum(jnp.dot(b0, b1_normalized), axis=-1, keepdim=True) * b1_normalized
    w = b2 - jnp.sum(jnp.dot(b2, b1_normalized), axis=-1, keepdim=True) * b1_normalized

    x = jnp.sum(v * w, axis=-1)
    y = jnp.sum(jnp.cross(b1_normalized, v) * w, axis=-1)

    return jnp.atan2(y, x)

However, the original `calculate_torsions` expects 2D tensors for batch processing (like in the last call `calculate_torsions(*a)` where `a` is 4, -1, 3). The JAX code above is for single points. To handle batches, need to adjust dimensions. But given the complexity and the user's request for only the code output without explanation, here's the direct translation focusing on autograd and tensor operations in JAX, assuming inputs are properly shaped for batches.

Final JAX code (assuming batch processing):
import jax
from jax import numpy as jnp
from jax import jit, vmap

@jit.jit
def calculate_torsions_jax(p0: jnp.ndarray, p1: jnp.ndarray, p2: jnp.ndarray, p3: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
    # Ensure inputs are batched appropriately (p0, p1, p2, p3 have shape (N,3))
    b0 = -1.0 * (p1 - p0)
    b1 = p2 - p1
    b2 = p3 - p2

    # Normalize b1
    norms_b1 = jnp.linalg.norm(b1, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    b1_normalized = jnp.clip(b1 / norms_b1, -1.0, 1.0)  # Avoid division by zero

    v = b0 - jnp.sum(jnp.dot(b0, b1_normalized), axis=-1, keepdim=True) * b1_normalized
    w = b2 - jnp.sum(jnp.dot(b2, b1_normalized), axis=-1, keepdim=True) * b1_normalized

    x = jnp.sum(v * w, axis=-1)
    y = jnp.sum(jnp.cross(b1_normalized, v) * w, axis=-1)

    return jnp.atan2(y, x)

But the original code's `calculate_torsions` returns a
