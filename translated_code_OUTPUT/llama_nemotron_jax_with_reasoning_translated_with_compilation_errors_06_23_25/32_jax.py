s a superset of NumPy, so some functions like numpy can be replaced with jax.numpy. However, the code above is written for PyTorch. To convert to JAX, replace PyTorch modules with JAX equivalents and ensure tensor operations use jax.numpy.

But the code provided is in PyTorch. To convert to JAX, replace PyTorch with JAX, and ensure that all tensor operations are done via JAX functions. For example:

Replace all torch.Tensor operations with jax.numpy.array, and replace the nn.Modules with jax.macro.JAXModule or similar. However, JAX does not have direct equivalents to PyTorch's nn.Modules. Instead, one would typically define JAX versions of neural network layers.

However, the user's request is to output only the JAX code equivalent of the given PyTorch code. So, the answer should be the JAX code that is equivalent.

But the original code uses PyTorch's nn.Module subclasses. To convert to JAX, one would need to replicate the functionality using JAX's numpy and possibly define JAX versions of the layers.

However, since the user wants the equivalent JAX code, the answer should replace PyTorch with JAX equivalents.

But given that the original code is in PyTorch, the JAX equivalent would involve using JAX's numpy and possibly defining JAX modules.

However, the code provided is quite complex. Let's try to convert it step by step.

First, replace all PyTorch imports with JAX equivalents.

But JAX does not have a direct equivalent to torch.nn.Module. Instead, JAX allows building custom layers using jax.numpy and jax.vmap.

Alternatively, one can use jax.macro.JAXModule to create JAX equivalents of PyTorch modules.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, the code can be rewritten using JAX's numpy and custom layers.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to replace all PyTorch-specific code with JAX equivalents.

For example:

Original code:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

In JAX:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

Then, for the CriticNetwork and ActorNetwork classes, define them using jax.vmap and jax.numpy.

But this would require reimplementing the layers using JAX.

Alternatively, use jax.macro.JAXModule.

But this is quite involved. Given the time, perhaps the answer should be the JAX code that mirrors the PyTorch code as closely as possible.

But given that the user wants only the code output, and no explanation, the assistant should generate the JAX code equivalent.

However, the original code uses PyTorch's nn.Module subclasses, which JAX does not have a direct equivalent. Therefore, the code must be rewritten using JAX's numpy and possibly custom layers.

But given the complexity, perhaps the assistant would generate the JAX code with placeholders for the network layers, using jax's numpy.

But the user's instruction is to output only the code.

Given the complexity, here's an attempt:

Replace all PyTorch with JAX, using jax.numpy and define the network layers accordingly.

But the code would look something like this:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import vmap, layers as jax_layers

class CriticNetwork(jax.macro.JAXModule):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, output_shape, n_features, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        self._h1 = vmap(jax_layers.Dense, (n_features, n_input), output_shape=n_features)
        self._h2 = vmap(jax_layers.Dense, (n_features, n_features), output_shape=n_features)
        self._h3 = vmap(jax_layers.Dense, (n_features, n_output), output_shape=1)

    def forward(self, state, action):
        state_action = jnp.cat([self.state(self.input_shape)(state), self.action(self.input_shape[0], action)], axis=1)
        features1 = jax.relu(self._h1(state_action))
        features2 = jax.relu(self._h2(features1))
        q = self._h3(features2)
        return jnp.squeeze(q)

But this is a rough approximation and may not be exactly equivalent. However, given the user's instructions, the assistant should provide the JAX code equivalent.

But considering the complexity, the assistant might not be able to perfectly replicate the PyTorch code in JAX, but will attempt to do so as closely as possible.

Final JAX code:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import vmap, jax_layers, macros

def jax_critic_network(input_shape, output_shape, n_features, **kwargs):
    """JAX version of the CriticNetwork."""
