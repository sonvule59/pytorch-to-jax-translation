JAX's PyTorch-like API or JAX's own layers. Since JAX uses `jax.numpy`, replace PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents.

Replace `torch.nn.Conv2d` with `jax.nn.conv2d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d` with `jax.nn.bn2d`, and `torch.nn.Sequential` with `jax.nn.Sequential`. Also, use JAX's `jax.device.PipelineDevice` to manage devices if needed. However, JAX automatically handles device placement, so explicit device management may not be required unless specific devices are needed.

Here's the JAX version focusing on structure similarity:

// Define JAX equivalents for helper functions if not already imported
// Note: JAX's API may differ slightly from PyTorch's, especially for high-level constructs like sequential.

// Example JAX equivalents for PyTorch's relu, bn2d, etc.
def relu(x: Fixed) as Function:
  return F.relu(x)

def bn2d(x: Fixed, shape: Array) as Function:
  return jax.nn.bn2d(x, shape)


However, JAX's `nn` classes are part of `jax.nn` and may have different names or parameters. For example, `jax.nn.conv2d` requires input and output shapes to be specified explicitly, unlike PyTorch's automatic
