Use JAX transformations, map PyTorch layers to JAX equivalents, and replace PyTorch functions with JAX equivalents. Note that JAX has its own types (e.g., `tf.Tensor` instead of `torch.Tensor`). Use `jax.numpy` for NumPy-like operations. Also, JAX requires explicit device placement (e.g., `jax.device_set(device='cpu')`), but for simplicity, assume CPU.

Replace all PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents. Note that JAX does not have direct equivalents for all PyTConv layers, so we might need to reimplement them using JAX's functional APIs or JAX's PyTorch integration (if enabled). However, since JAX encourages using pure JAX for scientific computing, we'll aim to use JAX's equivalents.

But since the user wants equivalent JAX code, assuming that JAX is properly set up, and using JAX's types.

However, the code uses torchvision's ResNet, which is PyTorch-only. So, we need to reimplement the backbone using JAX's equivalents.

But JAX doesn't have a built-in ResNet. So, we need to reimplement the backbone using JAX's functional convolutions.

Alternatively, if using JAX's PyTorch integration (jax_pytorch), we can map the layers. But the user might not have that. So, safer to use pure JAX.

Therefore, reimplement the backbone using JAX's functional convolutions.

But the original code uses ResNet18's backbone as part of MedCNN. So, we need to reimplement that.

But given the complexity, perhaps the user expects a direct translation using JAX's equivalents for PyTorch layers.

But since the original code uses torchvision's ResNet, which is not directly translatable, perhaps the answer should use JAX's own layers.

But the user's instruction is to translate the Python code (PyTorch) to JAX code. So, assuming that the code is using standard PyTorch layers, and JAX has some integration (like jax.pytorch), but the answer should use JAX-native code.

Alternatively, the code can be translated using JAX's equivalents for the layers used.

But given that the code uses a custom MedCNN class that includes a ResNet backbone, and the ResNet is not directly translatable, perhaps the answer should reimplement the backbone using JAX's functional convolutions.

But this is complicated. However, the user's instruction is to output only the code.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the answer should replace PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents, using JAX's functional API for convolutions.

But the code also uses torchvision's ResNet, which is not directly translatable. So, perhaps the answer should replace the ResNet backbone with a JAX-implemented equivalent.

But this is a lot of code. However, the user wants only the code output.

So, the JAX code would look something like this:

import jax
from jax import devices
from jax.numpy import array
from jax import functional as jf
from jax import random

# Set up JAX devices (assuming CPU)
device = devices CPU

# Define JAX arrays
batch = jax.random.PRND(array=(device(), 1))
num_slices = 10
channels = 3
width = 256
height = 256

# Generate synthetic data (using JAX functional API)
ct_images = jf.random.normal(array=(batch, num_slices, channels, width, height), seed=42)
segmentation_masks = (jf.random.uniform(array=(batch, num_slices, 1, width, height)) > 0.5).cast(jax.float()).clip(min=0.0, max=1.0)

# Define MedCNN using JAX functional layers

            kernel_size=(3,3,3),
            strides=(1,1,1),
            padding=(1,1,1)
        )
        self.conv2 = jf.conv3d_out(

            padding=(1,1,1)
        )
