Wait, there's an error in the JAX code where DNNModelModel's fc2 is referenced as DDNModel, which is a typo. Should be DNNModel. Also, the JAX code uses MinMaxLoss, but the original PyTorch code uses MSELoss. However, the user asked for equivalent JAX code, so preserving the loss type might be correct. But the main task is to translate the code accurately. However, the initial code provided by the assistant had some mistakes, like in the JAX model definition. Let me correct that.

But according to the problem statement, the user wants the Python to JAX translation, ensuring correctness. So the main steps are:

1. Replace PyTorch modules with JAX equivalents.
2. Use JAX's JIT compilation where applicable.
3. Handle JAX-specific features like JustInTimeCompilation, block scattering, etc.
4. Correct any typos (like the DDNModel typo).

So correcting the JAX code:

In the DNNModelModel's __init__, the third block should reference DNNModel's fc2, not DDNModel.

So:

class DNNModelModel(jax.object):
    __init__(self):
        # Build the model graph
        self.block = Sequential([
            Block("fk1", DNNModel.fc1),
            Block("relu", DNNModel.relu),
            Block("fk2", DNNModel.fc2)
        ])
    
    @jit(injit_classid="jax.nn.jit")
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.block(self)[0]

Also, the JAX code uses MinMaxLoss, which is correct for JAX. The original PyTorch code uses MSELoss, but since the user wants equivalent code, using MinMaxLoss in JAX is acceptable unless specified otherwise. However, the user might expect the same loss function. Wait, but JAX's MinMaxLoss is equivalent to PyTorch's MSELoss when the reduction is'mean' or'sum', but by default, it's'sum'. The original code uses MSELoss, which by default uses sum. So it's equivalent. So that's okay.

Another point: In the JAX code, the training loop uses BackendExecutor for a loop, but in the original PyTorch code, it's a for loop. However, in JAX, using BackendExecutor allows for more efficient execution, especially with JIT.

Also, the
