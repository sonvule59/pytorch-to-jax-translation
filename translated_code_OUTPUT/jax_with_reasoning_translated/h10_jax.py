**Important Notes:**
1. **Model Architecture:** The JAX code uses `jax.lite.models.ResNetV1` for compatibility but may need adjustments for exact behavior.
2. **Grad-CAM Implementation:** JAX's native Grad-CAM is not straightforward. The provided code adapts PyTorch's Grad-CAM logic, which might not be accurate.
3. **Visualization:** JAX lacks native plotting libraries. You'd need to integrate `jax.vip` or similar for visualization.
4. **Device Training:** The example assumes all operations are on CPU for simplicity. Adjust device assignments as needed.

**Correct Approach for JAX:**
- Use `jax.lite` or `jax.vjp` for model definition if necessary.
- Leverage `jax.grad` for automatic differentiation.
- For Grad-CAM, refer to JAX's community implementations or use a library like `jax-gradcam`.
- For visualization, use `jax.vip` or `matplotlib` with careful device management.
