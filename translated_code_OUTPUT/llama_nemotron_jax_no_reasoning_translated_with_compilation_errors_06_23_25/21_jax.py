Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at each function and the operations they perform.

First, the pad_ids function. In the original code, it's using PyTorch tensors. In JAX, the data types are different. PyTorch uses torch.int for integers, but JAX uses jax.int64. Similarly, torch.bool becomes jax.bool, and torch.uint8 becomes jax.uint8. Also, the padding logic remains the same, so the structure should be similar. I'll need to adjust the data types and tensor types here.

Next, the dual_process_fn. Here, they're creating Torch tensors for features. In JAX, we should use jax.tensor_int64 for the input IDs, jax.tensor_bool for the attention masks, and jax.tensor_uint8 for the token type IDs. Also, the function returns a list of features, so each element in the list should be a JAX tensor instead of a PyTorch tensor.

Looking at the triple_process_fn, similar changes apply. The features are built using PyTorch tensors, which need to be converted to JAX equivalents. Also, the loop over cells processes each passage, so the same data type adjustments apply here.

The triple2dual_process_fn is a bit more complex. It appends different values (0 or 1) to the features. Since those are integers, in JAX they should be jax.int64. Also, the structure of the features list needs to match, adding those integers as part of the JAX tensors.

I should also check if any JAX-specific functions or conventions are needed. For example, JAX often uses the @jax.jit.default_jitter to speed up compilation, but the original code doesn't have that. Since the user wants valid JAX code, maybe it's better to include necessary imports, but the original code doesn't have any. Wait, the original code doesn't include imports, but the user's code starts with importing torch. However, in JAX, the equivalent import would be 'import jax'. But the user's code might not include that, but the problem says to output only valid JAX code. So perhaps the imports are not needed here, but the functions should use JAX types.

Wait, the original code uses functions that return PyTorch tensors. So in the JAX version, those functions should return JAX tensors. So replacing all PyTorch tensor creations with JAX equivalents.

For example, in the dual_process_fn, when they do torch.tensor(input_id_a, dtype=torch.int), in JAX that would be jax.tensor_int64(input_id_a). Similarly for the other tensors.

Also, note that in JAX, it's common to use jax.nn.Linear or other JAX modules, but the original code doesn't use any neural network operations, just tensor creation. So the main changes are data type conversions and ensuring all tensors are JAX-compatible.

Another thing: the original code uses 'torch.tensor', which creates a Python list containing a tensor. In JAX, when using jax.tensor_int64, it's better to create tensors directly using jax.tensor_int64() without wrapping in another list. Wait, but in the original code, features are lists containing PyTorch tensors. So in JAX, each element in the list should be a JAX tensor. So for example, instead of [torch.tensor(input_id_a,...)], it would be [jax.tensor_int64(input_id_a,...)].

Wait, but in JAX, when you create a tensor, you can just use jax.tensor_int64(input_id_a) directly. So in the dual_process_fn, the line features += [torch.tensor(input_id_a,...)] becomes features += [jax.tensor_int64(input_id_a,...)], and similarly for the others.

Also, the pad_ids function in PyTorch returns tensors of certain types. In JAX, the same function should return JAX tensors with adjusted dtypes. For example, input_ids would be jax.tensor_int64, attention_mask_a as jax.tensor_bool, and token_type_ids_a as jax.tensor_uint8.

Wait, but in the original code, the pad_ids function is handling the padding, so the inputs and outputs are tensors. So in JAX, the parameters and return values should be JAX arrays/tensors with the correct data types.

Additionally, in JAX, it's common to use jax.array instead of torch.Tensor. So replacing all torch.* references with jax.array where possible. But in functions like pad_ids, the code is using list operations, so the JAX version would use jax.array for the inputs and outputs.

Wait, but in the original code, input_ids, attention_mask_a, and token_type_ids_a are PyTorch tensors. So in JAX, these would be j
