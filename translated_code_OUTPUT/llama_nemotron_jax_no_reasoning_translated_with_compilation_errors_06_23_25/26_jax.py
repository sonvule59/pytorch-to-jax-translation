Just to clarify, the task is to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX, not to raylib. But the code provided is part of Raylib's TorchModel interface. However, the user's instruction says to translate the Python code using PyTorch to JAX, so focus on converting the code.

But the code includes Raylib's `PublicAPI` decorator and `restore_original_dimensions` function, which is part of Raylib's API. However, JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent. But the user wants to output valid JAX code. So perhaps the user wants to convert the PyTorch code to JAX, assuming that some parts (like the Raylib wrappers) are to be adapted, but the user's main focus is on the model's forward pass.

But the code given is part of a Raylib model, which uses PyTorch. The user wants to convert this code to JAX. However, JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent of PyTorch's `nn.Module`. Instead, JAX uses `jax.nn.Module` or `jax.nn.ModuleDict`, etc.

But the code provided is a custom RLlib model using PyTorch. To convert this to JAX, we need to replace PyTorch with JAX modules. However, the `@PublicAPI` decorator is part of Raylib, which is separate from JAX. So perhaps the user wants to focus on the JAX-compatible parts, ignoring the Raylib-specific parts, or perhaps the code is illustrative and the main task is to convert the model's forward pass and structure to JAX.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a PyTorch-based model in Raylib, and the user wants to convert that model to use JAX instead of PyTorch. But the code is written in Python, using PyTorch's `nn.Module`. So the conversion would involve replacing PyTorch with JAX's equivalents.

But the code includes a `forward` method (implemented via `_forward`), which is part of the model. So the main task is to rewrite the PyTorch code (the network) using JAX.

But the code provided is incomplete, as `_forward` is not implemented. However, the user's instruction is to translate the code as given. So perhaps the code is just a template, and the user wants the JAX equivalent structure.

But the code includes `torch.nn as nn`, and uses `raise NotImplementedError` in `_forward`.

So, the JAX code would replace `torch` with `jax`, `nn` with `jax.nn`, and adjust the imports accordingly. However, the code also uses `tensorlib=torch` in `restore_original_dimensions`, which is part'tensorlib' library. In JAX, the equivalent might be `tensorlib=jax`.

But the user's code is using `PyTorch` code within a Raylib model, and the task is to convert that code to JAX. However, the code provided is incomplete, so perhaps the user just wants the structure converted, not the actual model implementation.

But given the code, the main changes would be:

- Replace `torch` with `jax`
- Replace `nn.Module` with `jax.nn.Module`
- Replace `nn.Module.__init__` with `jax.nn.Module.__init__`
- Replace `torch.nn.Module` with `jax.nn.Module`
- The `forward` method in PyTorch is not directly available; in JAX, the equivalent is `forward()` method in `jax.nn.Module`, but in the given code, the forward is implemented via `_forward`.

But the code provided is part of a Raylib model, which uses `@PublicAPI`, which is part of Raylib's API, not JAX. So perhaps the user is aware of that and just wants the JAX-compatible parts translated.

But the user's instruction says: "Translate the following Python code using PyTorch to JAX. Output only valid JAX code. No explanation or markdown."

So the code provided is PyTorch code, and the task is to convert it to JAX code. The code includes some Raylib-specific decorators and functions, but the user wants the JAX version.

However, JAX and Raylib are separate libraries. So perhaps the code is part of a model that is to be converted to use JAX instead of PyTorch, but the `@PublicAPI` decorator is part of Raylib's API, which is separate. But the user's instruction is to translate the code to JAX, so perhaps the `@PublicAPI` decorator can be removed, or left as-is, but that's part of Raylib, not JAX.

But the user's code is written in Python, and the task is to output JAX code. So the main changes would be:

- Replace `torch` with `jax`
- Replace `nn` with `jax.nn`
- Adjust the imports to use JAX's modules
