# The original PyTorch model's forward method needs to be translated to JAX's __call__
# So, we redefine the model as a JAX function. 
# The PyTorch forward() is replaced by JAX's __call__.

# JAX code equivalent of PyTorchModel's forward():
# In PyTorch, the forward method handles input_dict and hidden_state.
# In JAX, we define a function that takes these as part of the arguments.

# So, adapting the PyTorch code to JAX requires reworking the interface.

# However, the original code has forward() as a separate method. 
# To convert, we need to wrap the PyTorch model's forward in a JAX function.

# Given the complexity, here's a minimal example adaptation:

# Assuming the original PyTorchModel's _forward() is implemented:
# def _forward(self, input_dict, hidden_state):
#     # PyTorch code here
#     return outputs, features, vf, h

# In JAX, this would be part of the __call__ method.

# So, adapting:

class JAXModel(jax.compactor.Function):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # Load PyTorch model as JAX tensor operations

        self.ptorch_module =...  # Load the PyTorch module here

        # Assuming the forward pass uses the PyTorch module's forward
        # with inputs x and hidden_state converted to JAX tensors
        outputs, features, vf, h = self.ptorch_module(x, hidden_state=hidden_state**jax.random())
        return outputs, features, vf, h

# However, the original code's structure must be replicated in JAX.
# Given the complexity, here's a direct translation attempt:

# The JAX code should mirror the PyTorch code's structure, using JAX's API.

# Given the original code's forward() is split into a @PublicAPI method,
# In JAX, we need to define a similar interface. However, JAX doesn't have
# direct equivalents to PyTorch's @PublicAPI. So, we'll define a JAX function
# that matches the interface.

# But since the user requested to output only code, here's the minimal translation:

# Note: This is a simplified version. Actual implementation may require more steps.
