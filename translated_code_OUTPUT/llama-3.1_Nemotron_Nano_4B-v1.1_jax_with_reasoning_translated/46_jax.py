Use `jax.numpy` for array operations and `jax.device` for device management. Replace all PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents. Replace `torch.nn.Module` with `jax.nn.Module`. Replace `torch.optim` with `jax.optim`. Replace `torch.autograd.grad` with `jax.autograd.grad`. Use `jax.device.device` for device management (CPU/GPU). Ensure input arrays are on the correct device.

Given the above PyTorch code, write the equivalent JAX code.

<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code into JAX. Let me start by understanding each part of the code.

First, the ResNetWSL class is an nn.Module. In JAX, that's jax.nn.Module. The layers like nn.Sequential become jax.nn.Sequential. The Pooling class WildcatPool2d is part of the custom pooling module, so I'll keep that as is but make sure it's imported correctly in JAX.

The forward method in PyTorch takes x and processes it through features, classifier, and spatial pooling. In JAX, the forward method should return the same computation but using JAX operations. Also, JAX requires setting the right devices. So, I'll replace torch with jax.numpy (like x = x.float()).device might be needed, but maybe JAX handles it if the input is on the correct device.

The get_config_optim method is for optimizer configurations. In JAX, this might not be a standard method, but since the user wants the code translated, I'll keep the structure, replacing PyTorch params with jax.nn.ModuleCheckpoint to save configurations. Wait, JAX has different ways of handling optimizers. Maybe the original method is for saving configs, so using jax.nn.ModuleCheckpoint would be appropriate here.

Looking at the imports: The original code imports WildcatPool2d from a custom module. In JAX, if the user has similar pooling modules, they might already have WildcatPool2d defined. So I'll just use it as is.

For the ResNet50 and ResNet101 functions, they create a ResNetWSL instance. The model is loaded from torchvision, then converted to JAX. But in JAX, models are often JIT compiled. However, the user might want a static version. So, perhaps the model isn't compiled here, just used as-is. But in JAX, the layers need to be compatible. However, the code might just be for configuration, so maybe the model remains as a native JAX model.

In the forward method, each layer in the nn.Sequential should be translated. For example, model.conv1 becomes whatever the first layer is in the ResNet model. But since the original code uses model.conv1, which is a PyTorch-specific notation, maybe in JAX it's model.conv1 as well, assuming the model is properly defined in JAX.

Wait, in JAX, the model definitions are different. For example, ResNet50 in JAX is JIT-compiled. But the user's code seems to use a pretrained model from torchvision, which is PyTorch-specific. So perhaps in JAX, the user would have a different way of loading the model. But the problem states to translate the code as-is, so maybe the model is a native JAX model. However, the original code uses torchvision.models.resnet50, which is a PyTorch model. To use that in JAX, perhaps it's not directly possible. But the user might have a JAX version of the ResNet. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the user's instruction says to replace PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents, but the model is from torchvision. So maybe the code is supposed to use a JAX model. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to use the same architecture but with JAX layers. But the original code uses a pretrained model from torchvision, which is a PyTorch model. So in JAX, the equivalent would be a model defined in JAX. However, the user's code might not have that. But the task is to translate the code structure, not the actual model definitions. So perhaps the code remains similar, but with JAX layers.

Wait, the user's code defines ResNetWSL taking a model as an argument. So in JAX, the model would be a JAX model. So the functions resnet50_wildcat and resnet101_wildcat would create instances of ResNetWSL with a JAX model.

But the original code uses torchvision's models. So in JAX, perhaps the user has their own ResNet models. But the code provided in the answer should just replace the PyTorch parts with JAX equivalents.

So, step by step:

1. Replace all PyTorch imports (torch.nn as nn) with jax.nn as nn.

2. The WildcatPool2d is part of a custom
