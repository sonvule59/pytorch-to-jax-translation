Import PyTorch functions and create a custom operator for dot product since JAX doesn't have a built-in equivalent. 
Use JAX's native functions for matrix multiplication and softmax.

However, the original code uses `torch.autograd.Variable`, which is PyTorch specific. In JAX, we use `jaxvfunc` or `jax.numpy` functions for variable handling.

Given the complexity of the translation, here is the JAX code:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import multivariate_root_inversion, matmul, softmax, shape

def dot(a, b):
    return jnp.dot(a, b.transpose(2, 1))

class Attention(jax-app):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def forward(self, query, key, value, dimensions=None):
        batch_size = jnp.shape(query)[0]
        n_keys = jnp.size(key)[1]
        dim_key = jnp.shape(key)[2]
        n_queries = jnp.size(query)[2]
        dim_query = jnp.shape(query)[2]
        n_value = jnp.size(value)[2]
        dim_value = jnp.shape(value)[2]

        # Assertions
        jassert jnp.array_equal(batch_size, jnp.array(query.size()[0], 1)), "query batch size mismatch"
        jassert jnp.array_equal(batch_size, jnp.array(key.size()[0], 1)), "key batch size mismatch"
        jassert jnp.array_equal(batch_size, jnp.array(value.size()[0], 1)), "value batch size mismatch"
        jassert jnp.array_equal(dim_key, jnp.array(dim_query)), "query and key dimension mismatch"
        jassert jnp.array_equal(dim_key, jnp.array(dim_value)), "key and value dimension mismatch"

        # Ensure dimensions is a tensor
        if dimensions is None:
            # Create a dummy dimensions tensor with shape (1, 1, dim_key)
            dimensions = jnp.array([1], [1], [dim_key]).expand_as(jnp.array([batch_size], [1], [dim_key]))
        else:
            jassert jnp.ndim(dimensions) == 3 and jnp.shape(dimensions)[2] == dim_key, f"dimensions must be tensor of shape ({dimensions.shape}) but got {dimensions.shape}"

        # Compute scores
        scores = dot(query, key.transpose(1, 2))
        # Compute scaling factor (assuming dimensions is the correct size)
        scaling_factor = jnp.sqrt(1. / dimensions)
        # Compute alpha matrix
        alpha = jnp.softmax(scores / scaling_factor, axis=2)
        # Compute output
        output = jnp.bmm(alpha, value)
        return output, alpha

However, the above code still has issues. For example, the dimensions handling might not be correctly implemented. A more robust approach would be to use the root inversion if needed, but for this case, assuming dimensions is properly set. 

But since the original code had a dimensions variable that was a Variable, in JAX, we can represent it as a tensor. Also, JAX autograd handles the gradients automatically.

But considering the original code's forward method returns output and alpha, the JAX version should do the same.

Final code after corrections:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import matmul, softmax

def dot(a, b):
    return jnp.dot(a, b.transpose(2, 1))

class Attention(jax.app.Application):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, query, key, value, dimensions=None):
        batch_size = query.shape[0]
        dim = query.shape[2]

        # Assertions
        jassert batch_size == key.shape[0], "query and key batch size mismatch"
        jassert batch_size == value.shape[0], "query and value batch size mismatch"
        jassert dim == key.shape[2], "query and key dimension mismatch"
        jassert dim == value.shape[2], "key and value dimension mismatch"

        # Handle dimensions
        if dimensions is None:
            # Assuming dimensions is the size for scaling, e.g., sqrt(dim)
            # For simplicity, assuming dimensions is dim, but adjust as needed
            scaling_dim = jnp.sqrt(dim)  # Example scaling; adjust based on actual use case
        else:
            scaling_dim = dimensions

        scores = dot(query, key)
        scaling_factor = jnp.sqrt(1 / scaling_dim)
        alpha = jnp.softmax(scores / scaling_factor, axis=2)
        output = matmul(alpha, value)
        return output, alpha

But the original code's dimensions parameter is a bit unclear. The original code's comment says dimensions is not used, but in the code, it's used as scaling_factor =
