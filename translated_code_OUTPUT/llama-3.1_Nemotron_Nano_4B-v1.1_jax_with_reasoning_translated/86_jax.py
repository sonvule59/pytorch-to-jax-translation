Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalents. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the imports. The original code imports PyTorch modules. In JAX, I'll replace torch withjax. But wait, JAX doesn't import modules exactly like PyTorch; instead, they use jax.numpy, jax.nn, etc. So I'll adjust the imports to use JAX's equivalents. For example, numpy becomes jax.numpy, and nn becomes jax.nn.

Next, the Net class. The PyTorch code defines a neural network using nn.Linear and nn.ReLU. In JAX, these are jax.nn.Linear and jax.nn.ReLU. So I'll rewrite the Net class using JAX modules. Also, the forward method should use jax operations instead of PyTorch's. For instance, jax.nn.functional.relu instead of nn.ReLU(). Wait, but in JAX, sometimes people just use the jax module's functions. So the ReLU can be jax.nn.relu, and PReLU as jax.nn.prelu. The Dropout is the same, just nn.Dropout becomes jax.nn.dropout? Wait, no. In JAX, the Dropout layer is handled via jax.nn.dropout, but maybe for simplicity, using jax.nn.Dropout would work. Or perhaps jax.nn.functional.dropout. Hmm, but in the original code, it's nn.Dropout, so in JAX, it's jax.nn.Dropout. Let me check: JAX's documentation shows that jax.nn.Dropout is acceptable. So the Net class in JAX would use jax.nn.Linear, jax.nn.ReLU, jax.nn.Dropout, etc.

Then, the model_creator function. It returns a PyTorch nn.Module. In JAX, the equivalent would be a JAX Module. So the function should return a jax.nn.Module. But when using JAX for training, perhaps the model is defined using jax.build_subgraph. Wait, but in the original code, they're using AutoEstimator from zoo.orca.automl.pytorch_utils, which probably handles the conversion. However, since we're moving to JAX, maybe the AutoEstimator needs to be adjusted. But the user's instruction is to translate the code, so perhaps the functions that create the model and optimizer need to be adapted.

Looking at get_optimizer: it returns a PyTorch optim.SGD. In JAX, the equivalent would be jax.optim.SGD. So the function should create and return a JAX optimizer.

The get_train_val_data function generates synthetic data using numpy. Since JAX uses jax.numpy, but the data generation here is in pure Python/NumPy, that part can stay mostly the same. However, when passing data to the model, it should be converted to JAX arrays. But in the original code, the data is passed as tensors. So in JAX, the data would be jax.numpy arrays.

The create_linear_search_space function uses hp.uniform and hp.choice. That's part of trax, the JAX autograd library. So I need to replace imports from PyTorch's hp to trax's hp. Wait, the original code imports from zoo.orca.automl.auto_estimator, which might be part of their PyTorch-specific code. But since we're moving to JAX, the imports should be adjusted to use trax. However, the user's code might have specific zoo-specific classes. But assuming that the AutoEstimator has JAX equivalents, perhaps the code would use trax's functions. But the original code's AutoEstimator is from zoo, so maybe in the JAX version, they have a similar API. However, the user's instruction is to translate the code, so I need to replace PyTorch-specific parts with JAX equivalents.

The main part is the train_example function. It uses auto_est.fit, which in PyTorch's zoo library might be part of their custom fit method. But in JAX, the typical approach is to use trax.autoclass.AutoEstimator or similar. However, since the original code uses a specific zoo library, perhaps the JAX version would have a similar structure but with JAX modules. Alternatively, the code might need to be restructured to use JAX's autograd features directly. But the user wants a direct translation, so I'll proceed accordingly.

In the Net module, the forward pass uses PyTorch operations. In JAX, the same functions would be available, but perhaps with different names. For example, jax.nn.functional.relu instead of nn.ReLU(). Wait, in JAX, you can use jax.nn.relu, which is a function that requires jax context. So in the Net's forward method, each operation would use JAX functions. For example:

def forward(self,
