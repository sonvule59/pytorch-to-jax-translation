JAX version output should have code only where JAX specific imports/uses are required.


<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me look at the original code. The code has a bunch of tests in classes under RestoreUtilsTest1 and RestoreUtilsTest2. The main task is to translate the Python code, especially the functions and the tests, into JAX code.

First, the imports. In PyTorch, they import numpy as np and torch. For JAX, I'll need jnp for numpy functions, and replace torch with jax.numpy where possible. Also, JAX has its own way of handling state dictionaries and saving/loading them. The original code uses serialize_state_dict and load_multi_state, which should have JAX equivalents. I remember that in JAX, the equivalent might be jax.nn.state_dict() and jax.load_state_dict(), but the user's code uses load_multi_state, which might be a custom function. Wait, the original code's load_multi_state isn't shown, but in PyTorch, it's not a standard function. Maybe the user has a specific implementation. Since the problem says to translate the Python code as given, I should assume that the functions like load_multi_state exist in the same way but adapted for JAX. However, in JAX, state handling is done with jax.load_state_dict(). So perhaps the original code's load_multi_state is similar to PyTorch's load_state_dict but with some differences. But since the user's code uses load_multi_state, maybe in JAX it's the same function but adjusted. Wait, the user's code might have a typo or be using a hypothetical function. But given that the user wants equivalent JAX code, I need to replace PyTorch-specific parts with JAX equivalents.

Looking at the test class RestoreUtilsTest1 in PyTorch, the test methods use functions like get_linear_param_names and get_nonlinear_param_names. In JAX, these might be similar, but perhaps they are part of jax.nn.utils. Also, the test uses serialize_state_dict, which in JAX can be handled with jax.nn.serialize_state_dict, but maybe the code uses the same function. However, the user's code might be using PyTorch's functions, so in JAX, these would need to be replaced with JAX equivalents. But since the problem states to translate the code, I should keep the same function names but adjust for JAX's API.

Wait, the user's code has functions like serialize_state_dict, which in PyTorch is part of torch.utils.checkpoint. But in JAX, state serialization might be different. However, the user's code might be using a hypothetical load_multi_state function. Since the problem says to output only the code where JAX specific imports/uses are required, I need to focus on changing parts that use JAX-specific features.

Looking at the original code's imports: they import from nupic.research.frameworks.pytorch. In JAX, the code would likely import from nupic.research.frameworks.jax. Also, the model MNISTSparseCNN and KWinners are part of the Nupic library but in JAX modules. However, assuming the model definitions are similar, the imports would stay as from nupic.torch.models import MNISTSparseCNN, KWinners, but in a JAX context.
