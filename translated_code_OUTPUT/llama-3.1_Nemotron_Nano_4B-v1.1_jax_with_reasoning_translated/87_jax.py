But the user wants to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalent, not the code they provided. Wait, the user provided a code snippet that has both PyTorch and some JAX code, but the task is to translate the Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code. So perhaps the code they provided is an example, and the actual task is to convert the PyTorch parts to JAX.

Looking at the original code:

The code imports PyTorch and torchvision, loads CIFAR10 data with transforms, creates DataLoaders, etc.

The user's task is to convert this PyTorch code to JAX equivalent.

But the code they also included some JAX code, which might be part of the example. But the user's actual request is to take the PyTorch code (like the variables defined here) and write equivalent JAX code.

So the main parts to convert are:

- Loading the dataset (PyTorch's CIFAR10 to JAX's equivalent)
- Creating DataLoaders (JAX has its own ways, but perhaps using jax.numpy for data handling)
- The transforms (normalization, tensor conversion)
- The training and testing loops (but in the example, they are not writing loops, just creating the data and loaders)

But in JAX, the approach is different. JAX is a functional framework, so data is handled with JAX arrays, and operations are applied with JAX functions.

So the steps would be:

1. Load the dataset using JAX arrays. However, JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent of PyTorch's datasets. So perhaps using JAX's native ways to load data, like reading images as JAX arrays.

But in the example, the user is trying to convert the PyTorch code to JAX. So the original code uses torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10, which returns a PyTorch tensor dataset.

In JAX, to load the data, one would read the images and convert them to JAX arrays. However, JAX doesn't have a built-in dataset class like PyTorch. So the code would need to be adjusted.

But the user's code example includes some JAX-specific code, like using jaxvjp and JIT compilation.

But the main goal is to translate the PyTorch code to JAX. So the key parts are:

- The transform pipeline: ToTensor() and Normalize. In JAX, this can be handled with JAX transforms.

But JAX has its own transforms, but perhaps using JAX's functional transforms.

Alternatively, since JAX operates on static data, the transforms can be applied using JAX functions.

But the main challenge is handling the dataset. Since JAX doesn't have a dataset class, the code would need to load the data into JAX arrays first, then create the DataLoader using JAX arrays.

But the user's code example includes code
