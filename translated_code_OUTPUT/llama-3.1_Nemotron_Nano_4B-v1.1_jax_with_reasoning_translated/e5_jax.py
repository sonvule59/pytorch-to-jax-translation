Wait, there's an error in the JAX code where DNNModelModel's fc2 is referenced as DDNModel, which is a typo. Should be DNNModel. Also, the JAX code uses MinMaxLoss, but the original PyTorch code uses MSELoss. However, the user asked for equivalent JAX code, so preserving the loss type might be correct. But the main task is to translate the code accurately. However, the initial code provided by the assistant had some mistakes, like in the JAX model definition. Let me correct that.

But according to the problem statement, the user wants the Python to JAX translation, ensuring correctness. So the main steps are:

1. Replace PyTorch modules with JAX equivalents.
2. Use JAX's JIT compilation where applicable.
3. Handle JAX-specific features like JustInTimeCompilation, block scattering, etc.
4. Correct any typos (like the DDNModel typo).

So correcting the JAX code:

In the DNNModelModel's __init__, the third block should reference DNNModel's fc2, not DDNModel.

So:

class DNNModelModel(jax.object):
    __init__(self):
        # Build the model graph
        self.block = Sequential([
            Block("fk1", DNNModel.fc1),
            Block("relu", DNNModel.relu),
            Block("fk2", DNNModel.fc2)
        ])
    
    @jit(injit_classid="jax.nn.jit")
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.block(self)[0]

Also, the JAX model class should be named appropriately. The original PyTorch code's model is DNNModel; in JAX, we can create a corresponding JAX model class.

Additionally, the training loop in JAX needs to use the correct optimizer and handle gradients properly. The original code uses.step(), but in JAX, optimizer.step() is sufficient if called appropriately within checkpoints.

Moreover, the JAX code should use jax.numpy for data and JAX arrays for computations, but in the code above, X and y are jnp arrays.

Also, the JAX code should compile the forward pass with JIT if possible.

Putting it all together, here's the corrected JAX code:
