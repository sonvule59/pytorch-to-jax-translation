 "Please use step-by-step reasoning to translate Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code. No explanation or markdown. Output only code."

 translate the given PyTjax code to JAX, replacing all PyTorch dependencies with their JAX equivalents. For example, replace `torch.nn.Linear` with `jaxjax.nn.Linear`, and use `jaxjax.autograd.grad` for gradient computations instead of `torch.autograd.grad`. Also, ensure that all functions are compiled with `@jax.jit` where necessary.

Given the code:

- Import statements (remove them as per instructions)
- Functions and classes defining network layers (Qestimator_resnet18, Qestimator_vgg16, Qestimator_naive)
- The forward method in Qestimator_naive

Translate each part accordingly.

Note: Since the user provided a code snippet with some functions and classes, the answer should translate those into JAX code, maintaining the structure but replacing all PyTorch modules with JAX equivalents. Assume that the user wants all the provided code (functions and class) translated.

Final Answer Should Only Contain the JAX code, no other text.

 "Output only code as per instructions."

Process each part:

1. Imports: Since the user said to output only code, and the original code had imports, but the instructions say to output only code (probably the translated code). However, the user's initial message says: "Output only code." So perhaps the imports should be translated as well, but the user's sample code starts with the functions after imports. However, the user's code includes the imports, but the instructions say to output only the code. So perhaps include the imports translated.

But the user's code starts with:

#import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
#import torchvision
from torchvision import models

But the user wants the JAX code equivalent. However, JAX doesn't have the same imports. Instead, in JAX, you import jax, jax.numpy as np, etc. But the user's code is about translating PyTorch code to JAX, so the imports would be different.

But the user's code includes:

import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

But in JAX, the equivalent would be:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import jit
# etc.

But the user's code has functions like Qestimator_resnet18, which in PyTorch uses models.resnet18. In JAX, the equivalent is models.resnet18 from jaxvision (if available) or similar. However, JAX doesn't have torchvision, but some models are available in jaxvision. However, assuming that the user wants to use the same model names as in PyTorch, but with JAX's modules.

But the user's code also has custom classes (Qestimator_naive). So the translation would involve replacing all PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents.

But the user's code includes:

def Qestimator_resnet18(**args):
    model_ft = models.resnet18(pretrained = True)
    num_ftrs = model_ft.fc.in_features
    model_ft.fc = nn.Linear( num_ftrs, args['num_label'] )
    return model_ft

In JAX, models.resnet18 would be from jaxvision.models, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if using jax's own models, but perhaps the user expects to use the same model names but with JAX's modules.

But given that the user's code also has custom layers (like Qestimator_naive), the translation would involve replacing all PyTorch nn modules with JAX's jaxjax.nn modules.

So for the first function:

def Qestimator_resnet18(**args):
    model_ft = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)  # Assuming models is from jaxvision.models
    num_ftrs = model_ft.fc.in_features
    model_ft.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, args['num_label'])  # Replace with jaxjax.nn.Linear

But in JAX, the pretrained parameter may not be available. Alternatively, if the model is loaded without pretrained, but the user's code uses pretrained=True. So perhaps in JAX, the equivalent is to load the model and then adjust the layers. However, this is model-specific and may
