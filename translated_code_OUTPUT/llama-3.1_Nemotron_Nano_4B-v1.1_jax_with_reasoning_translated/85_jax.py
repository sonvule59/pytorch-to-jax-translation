However, the user wants the output to be only the code, with no explanation. Given the original code, the JAX equivalent should directly translate the PyTorch classes, using JAX's constructs. However, the initial code provided by the user has some issues, like in the JAX code, the model initialization isn't correctly translated. But since the user's main request is to output the code step-by-step as per their instruction, the correct approach is to replace PyTorch modules with JAX equivalents where possible.

But considering that the user's original code for the JAX part is incorrect, perhaps the correct answer is to directly translate the PyTorch class to JAX using vjp, and adjust the forward method.

But given the complexity, the correct code would involve using jax.vjp to convert the PyTorch module, and then define the forward pass in JAX.

However, the user's original code for the JAX part is not correct. The correct approach would be:

The original PyTorch code defines a HumanPoseNet class with a VGG model. To convert this to JAX, using vjp, the model layers would be converted. However, the code provided by the user in the JAX section is not accurate. The correct code would involve using jax.vjp.ModuleFactory.build_module for the VGG model and then defining the forward pass in JAX.

But since the user's code is to be translated as-is, but with JAX code, the answer should mirror the structure but use JAX constructs.

However, the user's code for the JAX part is incorrect. For example, in the JAX code, the class HumanPoseNet is defined with jax.vjp.Module, but the code inside is not correct. The correct way is to use jax.vjp's ModuleFactory.

But given the user's instruction to output only the code with step-by-step reasoning (but no explanation), the assistant should provide the translated code as per the user's original code structure but in JAX.

However, the initial code's JAX part is incorrect. The correct JAX code would involve using jax.vjp to convert the PyTorch model. But since the user's code is not accurate, perhaps the assistant should provide the correct translation.

But the user's instruction says: "Please use step-by-step reasoning to translate Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code." So the assistant needs to translate the given PyTorch code to JAX.

The original PyTorch code defines a HumanPoseNet class that inherits from nn.Module,
