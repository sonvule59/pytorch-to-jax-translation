Not provided as specific requirements for this PyTorch/PyJAX code snippet.



<think>
Okay, I need to convert the provided PyTorch and PyJAX code to JAX. Let me look at each part step by step.

First, the imports. The original code uses PyTorch's torch and then switches to PyJAX's pyro and poutine. In JAX, the equivalent would be using jax.numpy for torch functions and jax.poutine for the PyJAX syntax. So I'll replace torch with jax.numpy and adjust the imports accordingly.

Looking at the test functions. The parametrize decorators are the same in JAX, so those can stay. The model definitions use pyro.plate_stack and pyro.sample. In JAX, the equivalent would be using jax plates or similar constructs. Wait, but the code seems to be using PyJAX's API directly. Since the user wants JAX code, maybe the models are written using JAX's own functions. However, the original code is written in a PyJAX style. Hmm, perhaps the code is already using JAX constructs but written in a PyPyTorch/PyJAX hybrid way. Wait, the user says "equivalent JAX code", so I need to ensure that all parts are in pure JAX.

Wait, the original code uses PyTorch's autograd with grad, but in the JAX version, they might use jax.grad. Let me check the functions. For example, in the first test, they create a model with pyro functions. In JAX, the same structure would use jax.poutine.trace, which is the same. The grad function in PyTorch is replaced with jax.grad in JAX.

So, in the first test function, when they compute the gradients, the lines using grad in PyTorch would need to be replaced with jax.grad. Let me check:

Original line:
for actual_grad = grad(expected_m, [logits], retain_graph=True)
assert_close(actual_grad, expected_grad,...)

In JAX, this would be:

actual_grad = jax.grad(expected_m, logits)[0](expectants, **logits.grads)
But need to handle the shape correctly. Alternatively, using jax.grad without specifying variables and then applying it.

Wait, in the original code, the logits are parameters, and expected_m is a tensor derived from samples. So when taking the gradient, it's with respect to logits. So in JAX, the gradient would be jax.grad(expected_m, logits).

But in the code, they compute the gradients by applying grad to expected_m, passing logits. So in JAX, the equivalent would be:

expected_grad = jax.grad(expected_m, logits)
value = expected_grad()

But need to make sure that logits is a tensor here.

Another point: the model definitions use PyJAX's API. Since the user wants JAX code, but the code is written in a way that's compatible with both PyTorch and PyJAX, perhaps the JAX version would use JAX's own functions but structure similarly. However, the code as written uses PyTorch's autograd for the grad function, which in JAX would not be present. So replacing grad with jax.grad is essential.

Also, the get_moments function uses torch.mean and torch.cat. In JAX, these would be jax.numpy.mean and jax.numpy.cat.

So, replacing all torch with jax.numpy, and grad with jax.grad. Also, the imports: in the original code, they import from torch.autograd.grad, but in JAX, that's not needed. Instead, use jax.grad.

Let me go through each part.

The test function 'test_gumbel_softmax':

- The line 'logits = torch.randn(...).requires_grad_()' becomes 'logits = jax.numpy.random.randn(...)' since in JAX, random functions don't require grad, but here we need to have gradients. Wait, no: in JAX, when using jax.grad, the inputs need to have gradients. So perhaps logits should be created with jax.grad enabled. Alternatively, since we're using PyJAX's poutine, maybe the requires_grad is handled differently. Wait, in the original code, logits are created with requires_grad_(), so that PyTorch can track gradients. In JAX, when using jax.grad, the inputs to the grad function must have gradients. So in JAX, when creating logits, they should be initialized with gradients. So perhaps:

logits = jax.grad(jax.numpy.random.randn)(*shape + (dim,)).apply_map_grad_all()

But maybe in the code, since the model uses logits in the RelaxedOneHotCategorical, which in PyJAX is part of the PyJAX API. So in JAX, the equivalent would be using jax.nn.functional.softmax or
