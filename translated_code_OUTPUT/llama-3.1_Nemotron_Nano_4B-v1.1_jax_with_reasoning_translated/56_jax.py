Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me look at each part step by step.

First, the test class uses PyTorch's assert_almost_equal. In JAX, there's jax.assert_true which can be used instead. Also, variables are handled differently. In PyTorch, char_input is a Variable with a LongTensor. In JAX, I should use jnp.random generating functions and maybe vmap for variables.

Looking at the first test: creating a Variable for char_input. In JAX, variables can be created using jax.make_mutable_op. But maybe using jax.random to generate the input. Wait, the original code uses a specific input tensor. In the JAX example provided, they used vmap(jax.random, 'char_input'), but the original input is a 4D tensor. Wait, the original char_input is a LongTensor of shape [2,2], but in the PyTorch code, it's written as Variable(torch.LongTensor([[[1, 0], [1, 1]]]]). Wait, that's a 3D tensor? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Because in NLP, character inputs are usually 2D (sequence length x vocab size). But the original code has [[[1,0], [1,1]]], which is 3D. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. But regardless, in JAX, the input should be generated using jnp.random. But the user's example code in the JAX part uses 'char_input' as a 4D tensor. Maybe there's a confusion here. But perhaps the main thing is to replace the Variable with a JAX-compatible input.

In the JAX code provided by the user, they used vmap(jax.random, 'char_input')(), but that might not be correct. Because jax.random returns a jnp array, and variables in JAX are created using jax.make_mutable_op. Wait, maybe the correct way is to create a jnp array and then use it as input. Since JAX uses functional APIs, variables are not needed in the same way as PyTorch. So instead of using Variable, just pass the jnp array to the distributed module.

Wait, the original PyTorch code uses char_input as a Variable. In JAX, variables are part of the computational graphs, but for testing, perhaps we can just generate the input as a jnp array. So for the first test, instead of creating a Variable, generate a random tensor using jnp.random and pass it to the distributed_embedding.

But the user's provided JAX code uses vmap(jax.random, 'char_input')(). Wait, jax.random is a function that returns a jnp array when called without arguments. So maybe the code should be something like char_input = jnp.random.randint(0, 2, size=(2,2)). But the original input in PyTorch is [[[1,0], [1,1]]], which seems like a 3D tensor. Maybe that's a mistake, and the actual input should be 2D. But the user's code in the JAX part has a comment saying "Assuming char_input is a 4D tensor", which might indicate that the original code's input was different. Hmm, perhaps there's a confusion in
