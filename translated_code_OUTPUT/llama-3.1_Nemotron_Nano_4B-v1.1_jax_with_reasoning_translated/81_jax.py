  def __init__(self, block, depth, cardinality, base_width, num_classes):
    #... same as pytorch __init__, but using jax types

    #... same as pytorch _make_layer, using jax types

  def forward(self, x):
    #... same as pytorch forward, adapted for JAX

def resnext29_16_64(num_classes=10):
  #... same as pytorch, but return jax.nn.Module

def resnext29_8_64(num_classes=10):
  #... same as pytorch, but return jax.nn.Module

But you want only the converted code without the comments or explanations, outputting only JAX code. Also, note that some PyTorch functions like init() are not available in JAX, so need to handle initialization manually.

Here's the step-by-step conversion:

For each nn module (like ResNeXtBottleneck and CifarResNeXt), replace PyTorch nn modules with JAX equivalents (jax.nn.Module).

Initialize parameters using jax.vjp.random.normal_initializer or similar. However, since the user's code uses init() functions which are PyTorch-specific, we need to handle initialization manually in JAX.

But the user's code has init calls in the CifarResNeXt __init__ for layers. For example:

if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
  n = m.kernel_size[0] * m.kernel_size[1] * m.out_channels
  m.weight.data.normal_(0, math.sqrt(2. / n))
elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
  m.weight.data.fill_(1)
  m.bias.data.zero_()
elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
  init.kaiming_normal(m.weight)
  m.bias.data.zero_()

In JAX, we can't use init.kaiming_normal, so we need to initialize weights using appropriate methods. For example, for Conv2d, Linear, and BatchNorm layers, we can initialize their weights with jax.random.normal or other JAX-friendly initialization methods.

However, the user's code may not handle this, but since the original code uses PyTorch's initialization functions, which are not available in JAX, we need to replace them with JAX equivalents.

But the user's code is to be converted directly, so perhaps the JAX code should replicate the same initialization steps using JAX's mechanisms.

But given that the user's code uses PyTorch's init functions, which are not present in JAX, we need to replace those parts with JAX code.

But the user's code is provided as:

import torch.nn as nn
import math

...

In the CifarResNeXt __init__, there are several init calls:

for m in self.modules():
  if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
    n = m.kernel_size[0] * m.kernel_size[1] * m.out_channels
    m.weight.data.normal_(0, math.sqrt(2. / n))
  elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
    m.weight.data.fill_(1)
    m.bias.data.zero_()
  elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
    init.kaiming_normal(m.weight)
    m.bias.data.zero_()

In JAX, these would be handled by initializing the weights during module construction.

For example, for Conv2d layers, we can initialize their weights with jax.random.normal.

But since the user's code is to be converted directly, perhaps the JAX code should replicate the same initialization steps using JAX's functions.

However, JAX does not have an 'init' function like PyTorch. So, for each layer type, we need to initialize accordingly.

But the user's code is to be translated as-is, so perhaps the JAX code should replicate the same logic, using JAX's equivalents.

But since the user's code uses PyTorch's init functions, which are not available in JAX, we need to replace those parts with JAX code.
