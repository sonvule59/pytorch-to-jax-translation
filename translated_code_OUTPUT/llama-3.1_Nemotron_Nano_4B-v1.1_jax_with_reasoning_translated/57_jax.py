 translate the PyTorch code to JAX code where possible, following best practices for JAX and PyTorch compatibility.

Okay, I need to translate the given PyTorch code to JAX while maintaining functionality. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the imports. The original uses PyTorch's nn and other modules. In JAX, we'll replace nn with jax.nn, torch with jax.trf, and so on. Also, since the code uses Opacus for differential privacy, but JAX doesn't have Opacus. Wait, the user wants to convert the PyTorch code to JAX equivalent. But Opacus is a PyTorch library. Hmm, maybe the user expects using JAX's privacy tools? Or perhaps they just want the structure converted, even if Opacus isn't directly applicable. The original code uses Opacus to add differential privacy to the training loop. But in JAX, there's no direct equivalent. However, the user might just want the code structure translated, leaving Opacus parts as-is if possible. But since the answer should be JAX code, maybe the Opacus part is omitted or adapted. Wait, the problem says "equivalent JAX code". So perhaps the Opacus part is not translated, but the rest is. But the user might not have considered that. Alternatively, maybe the code should use JAX's differential privacy features. But I'm not sure. Let me check the original code.

The original code uses Opacus's PrivacyEngine attached to the optimizer. In JAX, there's jax.random.PRIVXEngine, but integrating that with optimizers might be tricky. Since the user wants the code translated, perhaps the Opacus part is left as-is, but that's not possible because Opacus is PyTorch-specific. Alternatively, maybe the code should be adjusted to use JAX's equivalents. But given that the user wants the code translated, perhaps the Opacus part is omitted, or replaced with JAX's methods. However, the user's instruction is to translate the Python code written with PyTorch to JAX. So, perhaps the Opacus part can't be translated, but the rest can. But the user might expect the code to run in JAX with possible adjustments. Let me proceed.

Looking at the PyTorch code: The model is defined using nn.Module. In JAX, we can use jax.nn.Module. The forward method is similar. So the SampleConvNet class can be converted by replacing nn with jax.nn.

The data loading part: The original code uses TensorFlow datasets. In JAX, we might use jax.data. But the original code loads MNIST from tfds. Since the user wants JAX code, perhaps using jax.data.datasets.mnist. But the code in the PyTorch example is modified. Let me check the original code's data handling.

In the original code, data is loaded from tfds as numpy arrays, then preprocessed. In JAX, we can load the dataset using jax.data.datasets.mnist. But the code then converts the data into tensors. So replacing that part with JAX's dataset loader.

The training loop in PyTorch uses standard DataLoader. In JAX, we can use jax.data.DataLoader. But the data_stream function in PyTorch is custom. In JAX, the DataLoader would handle batching. So perhaps the data loaders can be replaced with JAX's equivalents.

The optimizer in PyTorch is SGD. In JAX, we can use jax.optim.SGD. Also, the privacy engine in Opacus is replaced with JAX's privacy features. But since Opacus isn't available in JAX, maybe the privacy part is omitted. However, the user's code includes Opacus for differential privacy. But the task is to translate the code to JAX. So perhaps the Opacus part is left as-is, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the code might not include the privacy part in JAX. But the user's instruction says to translate the code, so maybe the Opacus code is kept as is, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, the code might be adjusted to use JAX's differential privacy tools. However, integrating differential privacy in JAX's training loop is more complex. Given that the user wants the code translated, perhaps the Opacus part is left as a comment or omitted. But the original code uses Opacus, so the JAX code might not include the privacy mechanism. But the user's problem says to translate the code, so perhaps the Opacus part is left as-is, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the code might use JAX's built-in differential privacy. But I'm not sure. Let me proceed step by step.

The model definition: Replace nn with jax.nn. So SampleConvNet
