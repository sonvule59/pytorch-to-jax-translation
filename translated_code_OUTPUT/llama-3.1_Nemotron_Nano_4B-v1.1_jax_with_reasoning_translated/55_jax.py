2.24.0

Note: The code provided is PyTorch code converted directly to JAX, but JAX has additional features like
continuous control graphs (CCG) and other optimizations. To leverage these features fully,
it's recommended to use JAX's high-level APIs (e.g., `jax.train`, `jax.validate`, etc.). 
However, for simplicity and direct translation, the code below assumes a similar structure to the PyTorch code.

Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalent. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the imports. The original uses PyTorch functions. In JAX, some imports might differ. For example, JAX has its own data loaders and datasets, but maybe the user wants a direct translation using similar names. So I'll keep the import structure as similar as possible.

Looking at the CIFAR10 dataset import. In PyTorch, it's from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10. In JAX, maybe the same? Or is there a different way? Probably, the dataset class is similar, so I'll keep that line.

Next, the MetalCIFARDataset. The code defines a custom dataset. Since JAX is asynchronous, but the dataset logic here is synchronous, maybe it's okay. The JAX version note at the end says JAX 2.24.0, so perhaps some features are enabled.

The training function. In PyTorch, the training loop uses.train() and.eval() modes. In JAX, especially when using jax.benchmark or certain training functions, the approach might differ. However, the user wants a direct translation. So, perhaps the training loop structure remains similar, but using JAX's autograd.

Wait, in the original code, the model is defined with resnet_cifar10 from metal. In JAX, maybe there's a different module. But the user's note says to translate the code, so assuming that the JAX version of the module is similar. However, the original code imports from metal.contrib.modules.resnet_cifar10 as resnet. In JAX, maybe the module is different. Wait, JAX doesn't have a'metal' module in the standard library. Oh, but the user might be using a JAX application that includes MeTaL utilities. So perhaps the code is part of a JAX ecosystem that includes MeTaL. So the imports for the model and EndModel would remain similar, but adjusted for JAX's syntax.

Wait, the original code has:

from metal.contrib.modules.resnet_cifar10 as resnet

But in JAX, maybe the correct import is different. Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the JAX version of MeTaL. For example, in JAX applications, sometimes the modules are structured under jax.metal or similar. But without specific knowledge, perhaps the import remains the same, assuming that the user's environment has the necessary JAX MeTaL modules. Alternatively, maybe the code should use JAX's own implementations. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. But the user's instruction is to translate the PyTorch code to JAX equivalent, so perhaps the imports stay the same, but the code uses JAX's features.

Wait, the original code uses'metal.contrib.modules.resnet_cifar10 as resnet'. Maybe in JAX, this is part of jax.metal or another path. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the imports remain as they are, assuming that the environment has the correct JAX modules. Alternatively, maybe the code should use JAX's own ResNet. But the original code uses a specific MeTaL ResNet, so the translation should preserve that.

Moving on. The line 'cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()' is PyTorch-specific. In JAX, checking CUDA availability would be done via jax.device.check_device_type('cuda'). So that line should be replaced with something like:

device = jax.device.check_device_type('cuda')
model.to(device) if device else None

But in the original code, the model is initialized with'resnet =...' and then used. So in JAX, perhaps the model is created and placed on the device if CUDA is available.

Then, the argparse setup. PyTorch's argparse is different from JAX's. However, the user wants the code translated, so perhaps using JAX's command-line arguments? Or maybe the code is supposed to use JAX's own way of handling arguments. But the original code uses argparse, so maybe the JAX code keeps argparse as well. However, JAX doesn't have built-in argparse integration. So perhaps the code uses the same argparse setup, but in a JAX environment. But JAX runs in a restricted environment, so maybe the argparse is part of the script. Hmm, but the user's instruction is to output only the code, so
