Okay, I need to convert the provided PyTorch code to JAX equivalents. Let me start by looking at each class and the logic they use.

First, the Piecewise scheduler. In PyTorch, it's a subclass of _LRScheduler. It uses linear schedulers with different intervals. The key parts here are the gaps calculation and switching between schedulers. In JAX, the loops and list operations should be similar. I'll need to replace PyTorch's lists with JAX's arrays. Also, the Linear class in PyTorch uses a linear schedule, so in JAX, I should create a similar class using JAX's functions.

The Linear class in PyTorch uses a linear learning rate schedule. The get_lr method calculates the LR based on the last_epoch. In JAX, I can use jax.numpy functions for arithmetic operations. The parameters like start_lr, end_lr, and interval_length need to be handled. Since JAX uses JIT, the scheduler's step method must be compatible with JAX's event loop.

Then there's the CosineAnnealingLR class. In PyTorch, it uses a cosine annealing formula. The JAX version will need to use math.cos from the math module and jax.numpy for the calculations. The formula in JAX should be similar, but I need to ensure that the operations are compatible with JAX's JIT compiles.

I should check for any PyTorch-specific functions, like torch.optim.lr_scheduler's base classes, and replace them with JAX equivalents. For example, using JAX's jit to compile the scheduler functions.

Also, in JAX, the step method of the scheduler needs to be non-jittable if it's part of a JIT profile. Wait, but in JAX 2.24.0+, there's a way to handle this. Maybe using jax.vmap or ensuring that the step method is compiled within the same scope.

Wait, the original PyTorch code's step method might not be directly compatible. In JAX, the scheduler's step method should be handled through the JAX runtime. So perhaps the JAX code will structure the schedulers differently, using JAX's built-in schedulers or creating custom ones with JAX primitives.

Looking at the Linear class's step method in PyTorch, it's not properly implemented. The original code has a step() method but doesn't do much. The actual learning rate calculation is in get_lr. So in JAX, the Linear class should compute the LR in get_lr using JAX's operations.

For the CosineAnnealingLR, the get_lr method uses math.cos. In JAX, math functions are available via jax.math, but maybe it's better to use jax.numpy.cos if possible. Wait, jax.numpy.cos is a JIT-friendly alternative. So replacing math.cos with jax.numpy.cos would allow compilation.

Also, in the Piecewise class, the Linear schedulers are stored in a list. In JAX, arrays are preferred, but since the original uses a list, maybe keep it as a list unless there's a more efficient way.

Another consideration is that in JAX, the optimizer is a jax.optim.Optimizer, not torch.optim. So the imports should be from jax import optim, not torch.

Wait, the original code imports torch and uses torch.optim.lr_scheduler. In JAX, the equivalent would be jax.optim.lr_scheduler._LRScheduler, but since the user wants JAX code, all imports should be adjusted to use jax.

So replacing all torch imports with jax equivalents. For example, import jax, jax.numpy as np, jax.optim as optim, etc.

Also, the LambdaLR in PyTorch is replaced by the JAX scheduler setup. But in the given code, the Piecewise class initializes schedulers with Linear, each having their own parameters.

Putting this all together, the JAX code should replicate the structure but using JAX's modules. For example, the Linear class in JAX would compute the LR based on the last_epoch, using JAX's functions.

Testing each part step by step:

1. The Piecewise class initializes schedulers as a list of Linear schedulers. The Linear class in JAX would need to be defined similarly, using JAX's functions to compute the LR.

2. The Linear class in PyTorch's code has a step method that doesn't do much, but the actual LR calculation is in get_lr. So in JAX, the Linear class's get_lr should compute the LR using JAX's operations.

3. The CosineAnnealingLR uses math.cos, which in JAX can be replaced with jax.numpy.cos to enable JIT compilation.

So, rewriting
