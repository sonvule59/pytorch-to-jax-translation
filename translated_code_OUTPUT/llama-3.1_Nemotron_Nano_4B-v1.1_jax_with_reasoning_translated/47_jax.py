But I need to convert this PyTorch code to JAX equivalent. The user asked to output only the code, no explanations or markdown. So I need to translate each part step by step.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses `import torch`, JAX uses `import jax`. However, in the code, some other imports like `from reid.models import model_utils as mu` etc. are specific to PyTorch. But since the user wants to convert the code to JAX, perhaps some of these imports are not needed. But the code seems to be using the REID (Robust and Efficient Deep Learning) library, which has both PyTorch and JAX versions. So maybe the code is using the JAX version under the hood, but the user wrote it with PyTorch syntax. Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in PyTorch style but needs to be converted to JAX.

But the user's instruction is to translate the given Python code (written with PyTorch) to equivalent JAX code. So the code uses certain PyTorch functions and classes. For example, `DataParallel` is a PyTorch thing. In JAX, the equivalent is `jax.vjp.data.vjp_data_parallel` or similar. However, JAX's approach to data parallelism is different.

But given that the code is using the REID library, which has JAX versions, perhaps the code can be adapted by replacing PyTorch-specific functions with their JAX counterparts.

But the code provided by the user includes code specific to PyTorch, like `torch.cuda`, `torch.nn.DataParallel`, etc. So the challenge is to replace these with JAX equivalents.

However, the user's code also includes some custom imports and logic. For example, using `model_utils as mu` for predict_prob, which is a PyTorch function. In JAX, the equivalent might be different.

But given that the user wants a code translation, perhaps the answer should replace all PyTorch functions with their JAX counterparts where possible, and adjust the code structure accordingly.

But without knowing the exact functions in the REID library for PyTorch vs JAX, this could be challenging. However, the user's code seems to be a template, so perhaps the answer should use JAX's syntax and equivalents.

For example:

- `torch.cuda` → `jax.devices('cuda')` and tensors on the device.
- `torch.nn.DataParallel` → `jax.vjp.data.vjp_data_parallel` or similar.
- `model.load_state_dict` → JAX doesn't have this, but perhaps using `jax.nn.functional.load_state_dict`.
- `data.batcher` in JAX would be different.
- `torch.optim` → JAX has `jax.optimizers`.

But given that the code is not complete (e.g., the model is initialized with `models.create` which may have JAX-specific parameters), the translation is non-trivial.

However, the user's code includes lines like:

model = models.create(config.model_name, num_features=config.num_features, dropout=config.dropout, num_classes=config.num_classes)

Assuming that the `models` module in JAX is similar, but the parameters like `dropout` may be part of the config.

But given the uncertainty, perhaps the answer should replace all PyTorch-specific imports with JAX equivalents and adjust the code accordingly.

But the user's code also includes some custom code like `mkdir_if_missing`, `load_checkpoint`, etc., which are PyTorch-specific. However, these functions are part of the REID's data
