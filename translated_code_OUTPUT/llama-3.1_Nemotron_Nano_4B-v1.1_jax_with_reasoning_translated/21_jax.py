Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at each function and the operations they perform.

First, the pad_ids function. In PyTorch, it's creating padded IDs, masks, and type IDs based on input lengths and max_length. Since JAX uses similar slicing operations but with different functions, I'll need to adjust the padding logic. Also, PyTorch uses lists, and JAX works with JAX arrays, so maybe using JAX's pad_start, pad_end, etc., functions would be better. But the original code uses list operations. Alternatively, since the user wants equivalent code, I'll replicate the list operations but ensure they are compatible with JAX. However, in JAX, it's recommended to use JAX arrays for better performance. But given the original code uses lists, perhaps the JAX version should also use list operations, but with JAX-compatible dtypes.

Next, the input processing in dual_process_fn. The line is split into cells, and for the training case, it encodes the text using the tokenizer. In PyTorch, tokenizer.encode returns a tensor. In JAX, the equivalent would be using jax.numpy functions, but since the tokenizer is a PyTorch library, maybe we need to use jax.numpy.tokenizer.encode or similar. Wait, but the user probably expects using the same tokenizer but converted to JAX-compatible. However, JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent of PyTorch's tokenizer. So perhaps the code should use jax.numpy for the tensor operations, assuming that the tokenizer returns a JAX tensor. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the tokenizer's output is converted to a JAX array. But the original code uses PyTorch tensors, so in JAX, those would become JAX tensors. So replacing torch.tensor with jax.numpy might be necessary, but JAX requires all operations to be JAX-compatible. Wait, but the user's code is using PyTorch functions, and the task is to convert it to JAX. So the functions should return JAX tensors instead of PyTorch tensors.

Looking at the pad_ids function: in PyTorch, it's creating lists and returning them. In JAX, the equivalent would be JAX arrays. But the original code returns lists. However, JAX expects JAX arrays for operations. So perhaps the pad_ids function should return JAX arrays instead of lists. But the original code uses list operations. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the code should use JAX's pad_start and pad_end functions to handle padding. But the original code's logic is to pad on the right by default, unless pad_on_left is True. So in JAX, perhaps using JAX's pad functions would be more efficient. But the user's code might not be using those, so the direct translation would be to replicate the list operations but with JAX arrays.

Wait, but the user's code uses PyTorch's tensor and list structures. To convert to JAX, the lists should become JAX arrays, and tensors should be JAX tensors. However, in JAX, you can't mix PyTorch tensors and JAX operations. So all tensors must be converted to JAX arrays.

So, in the pad_ids function, instead of creating lists, we should create JAX arrays. But the original code's logic for padding needs to be replicated. Let's see:

Original code for pad_on_left is False: add padding to the end. So input_ids becomes the original IDs plus pad_token repeated padding_length times. Similarly for the mask and token_type_ids.

In JAX, perhaps using JAX.pad_start and JAX.pad_end. For example, if pad_on_left is False, we pad at the end. So input_ids_jax = jax.pad_end(input_ids_jax, padding_length, value=pad_token_id). But the input_ids in the original code is a list of integers. So in JAX, the input_ids would be a JAX array of long integers. So the code would need to use JAX's padding functions.

But the original code's approach is to create the padded lists by concatenation. So for JAX, perhaps the equivalent is to use JAX's pad functions. Let's adjust the pad_ids function to use JAX's pad functions.

Wait, but the user's code might not be using the most efficient method. The task is to translate the code as is, but in JAX. So perhaps the code should
