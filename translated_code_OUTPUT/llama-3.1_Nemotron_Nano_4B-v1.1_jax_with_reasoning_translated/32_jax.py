Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX equivalents. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the CriticNetwork and ActorNetwork classes use PyTorch layers. In JAX, the equivalents are jax.layers.ELU, jax.layers.Linear, etc. So I'll replace nn.Linear with jax.Linear and similar for other layers. Also, the forward methods in the networks need to use JAX functions like jax.numpy.squeeze instead of torch.squeeze.

The experiment function sets up the algorithm. The algorithm DDPG and TD3 from mushroom_rl are already compatible with JAX, so no changes there. The Gym environment is also JAX-friendly, so that's okay.

The imports: PyTorch's torch and nn are replaced with jax import statements. However, JAX doesn't require explicit imports for some functions, but for modules like nn.Module, I need to adjust the class definitions to use JAX layers.

In the CriticNetwork's __init__, the nn.Linear calls become jax.layers.Linear. Similarly for the other layers. The forward method in CriticNetwork combines state and action using torch.cat, which should be jax.numpy.cat since JAX uses a different API for arrays.

The ActorNetwork's forward method also uses torch.squeeze, which should be jax.numpy.squeeze. Also, the state is squeezed along the last dimension, so in JAX, state.squeeze(1) instead of torch.squeeze(state, 1).

The optimizer settings in the experiment function: PyTorch's optim.Adam is compatible with JAX's optim.Adam, so no changes there.

The compute_J function isn't shown in the code, but assuming it's part of the JAX ecosystem or converted, but since the original code uses it, I'll keep it as is.

Other parts like the Core class and Logger might need adjustments if they rely on PyTorch, but since the user mentioned to translate the code, assuming these are already JAX-compatible or adapted. However, looking at the original code, the Core class is part of mushroom_rl and might be JAX-ready.

The main changes are in the network definitions, replacing PyTorch layers with JAX equivalents and ensuring tensor operations use JAX functions. Also, ensuring that all imports from PyTorch (torch, nn) are replaced with JAX imports (jax.numpy, jax.layers, etc.).

Wait, in JAX, you don't need to import torch or nn. Instead, you import jax.numpy as jnp, jax.layers as jlayers, etc. So the code should replace all torch and nn references with JAX equivalents. For example, torch.nn.Linear becomes jlayers.Linear.

Also, in the forward methods, when concatenating state and action, since JAX uses a different API, using jnp.cat instead of torch.cat. Similarly, for squeezing, jnp.squeeze instead of torch.squeeze.

So, modifying the CriticNetwork's forward method: state_action is jnp.cat((state.float(), action.float()), 1). Then processing through the layers.

Same for ActorNetwork's forward: state is squeezed on the last dimension (state.squeeze(1)), converted to jnp.squeeze.

Additionally, the initializations for the weights use nn.init.xavier_uniform_, which in JAX can be done via jax.random.uniform_ or other JAX functions, but since the original code uses xavier_uniform_ with a gain, maybe JAX's init.xavier_uniform_ is available. Wait, JAX provides jax.init.xavier_uniform_ for initializing buffers, but for parameters, perhaps using jax.random.uniform_ with a seed. However, the original code uses nn.init.xavier_uniform_ with a gain. Hmm, JAX's Linear layer has a parameter 'init' which can be a function. So maybe in JAX, we can use jlayers.Linear with init=jax.random.uniform_(weight=1e-7, seed=42) or similar. But the original code's gain might not directly translate. Alternatively, JAX's xavier_uniform_ might be available via the 'params' when creating the layer. Wait, looking up JAX documentation: jax.layers.Linear has an 'init' parameter where you can pass an initialization function. So perhaps replacing nn.init.xavier_uniform_ with jax.random.uniform_ with a specific seed. But the original code's gain might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe JAX's default initialization is sufficient. For the sake of this translation, I'll replace the nn.init calls with JAX's equivalent by using the init parameter of Linear layers.

So in CriticNetwork's __init__:

self._h1 = jlayers.Linear(n_input, n_features, init=jax.random.uniform_(size=initializers.NPfloat, seed=42))
