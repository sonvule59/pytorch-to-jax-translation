Assuming the following PyTorch code is equivalent to the desired JAX code

Output only code.


<think>
Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at the PyTorch code structure. The main components are the PAIRConv layers and the PAIRGAT model class.

First, the imports. The original code imports PyTorch modules like nn, dgl, etc. In JAX, I should replace PyTorch with jax.multiprocessing.import_jax_module. But since some functions are specific to DGL (like DGLDataset, data, fn, etc.), I need to make sure those are properly imported. However, the user wants only the code, so maybe just the necessary imports. Wait, the original code uses dgl and torch. In JAX, the equivalent would be using jax with the necessary functions. But the user's code includes imports like from dgl import data, DGLDataset, etc. So in JAX, these would be part of the DGL module. But since the user wants the JAX code, perhaps the imports should be adjusted to use JAX's equivalents. Wait, noâ€”DGL is a separate library, but when using JAX, DGL's data handling might still be similar. However, the main point is to replace PyTorch functions with JAX equivalents.

Looking at the model class, PAIRConv is a custom layer. In PyTorch, it's defined as a subclass of nn.Module. In JAX, the user might need to define similar layers using JAX's functional APIs. But JAX doesn't have a built-in PAIRConv, so the user would need to reimplement the layer using JAX constructs. Wait, but the user's instruction is to translate the Python code written using PyTorch to equivalent JAX code. So the PAIRConv classes in PyTorch need to be replicated in JAX using JAX's functional API, perhaps.

Wait, but JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent. So the user might need to reimplement the layers using JAX's functional modules. For example, in PyTorch, PAIRConv might use attention mechanisms. In JAX, attention can be implemented using jax.vmap.attn or similar functions.

Looking at the PyTorch code, the PAIRConv layer in the input layer has in_feats and out_feats. The num_heads is part of the attention parameters. The forward method applies the attention and then a linear transformation. But in JAX, the code structure would need to use JAX's linear functions and attention.

Wait, but the original code's PAIRConv might be a custom implementation. Since the user hasn't provided the full PyTorch code for PAIRConv, only the model's forward method, perhaps the JAX code should replicate the structure using JAX's functional blocks.

Alternatively, maybe the PAIRConv in the original code is a standard layer, but given that it's called PAIRConv, it's likely a custom attention-based layer. However, without the full implementation, it's hard to tell. But the user's code shows that the forward method in the model loops through the layers, applying each PAIRConv layer, then flattens the output.

In JAX, the code structure would be similar, but using JAX's jit-compiled functions. So the model's forward function would need to be adapted to work with JAX's data structures and functions.

Looking at the forward method in PyTorch: it takes inputs, loops through the layers, applies each layer, flattens, and finally the output layer. In JAX, the equivalent would be similar, but using JAX's data types and functions.

The key points to change are:

1. Replace PyTorch modules (like nn.Linear) with JAX's jax.nn.Linear.
2. Replace PyTorch functions (like F.relu, edge_softmax) with JAX equivalents (jax.nn.functional.relu, jax.nn.functional.softmax).
3. The DGL parts (like DGLDataset, data, etc.) might remain similar, but since the user is translating to JAX, perhaps those are part of the DGL library which is compatible with JAX. So the imports would stay as from dgl import data, DGLDataset, etc., but using JAX's JIT.

Wait, but the user's code includes dgl and torch imports. In the JAX code, the torch parts need to be replaced with JAX's equivalents. For example, torch.nn.Linear becomes jax.nn.Linear. Similarly, functions like edge_softmax become jax.nn.functional.edge_softmax.

Looking at the model's forward method in PyTorch: after processing each layer, the output is flattened. In JAX, the same applies. Also, the edge_softmax in the attention mechanism would be replaced with the JAX equivalent.

So, the PAIRConv layers
