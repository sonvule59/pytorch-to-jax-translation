# JAX code equivalent 

# Define the neural network (assuming it's defined with JAX already)
# For example:
# class NCN(nn.Module):
#     def __init__(self):
#         super().__init__()
#         # Use JAX layers here
#         self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=0)
#         #... rest of layers...

# Replace PyTorch with JAX (assuming the model is already JAX-compatible)
# No changes needed if model uses JAX

# Define the environment with JAX

# JAX environment setup
def jax_env_step(npc, state, env_func, env):
    # Assuming env_func generates next state and reward given current state and action
    action = jrandom.uniform(0, 1) # Example action generation
    next_state, reward = env_func(state, action)
    transition = Transition((state, action, next_state, reward))
    return next_state, reward, transition

# JAX-converted environment loop
def jax_env_render(npc, state):
    env = env_in_jax # Need to define env_in_jax as the JAX environment instance
    plt.imshow(env.render()) # Assuming render is compatible or needs adaptation

# Other JAX-specific code like vmap, lru_cache, etc. as needed

# Note: Many PyTorch-to-JAX conversions require the model to use JAX from the start.
# Key changes include using jnp instead of Tensor, and ensuring all operations use JAX-compatible functions.

# Output only the code. 
# Assuming the original PyTorch code is transformed line by line with JAX equivalents.

# Example of PyTorch to JAX for the above snippet:

# Original:
# state = Variable(torch.FloatTensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]))
# action = torch.rand(1)
# next_state =... 

# JAX:
# state = jnp.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=jnp.float64)
# action = jrandom.uniform(0, 1)
# next_state =... 

# So the final answer should only output the JAX code equivalent, line by line, without explanations.
# Given the original code is not provided, but the user asks for the conversion of the provided PyTorch snippet.

# However, the user's original code is not given, only a sample of PyTorch-to-JAX conversion instructions. 
# Since the user's initial code is not provided, but the assistant's task is to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX, but in the initial message, the user provided a PyTorch code snippet (the first code block) and wants the JAX equivalent.

# Looking at the original PyTorch code:

# Import statements for gym, math, etc. are to be replaced with JAX equivalents or left as is if not applicable.

# The code converts PyTorch tensors to JAX equivalents where possible.

# The key parts to convert are:

# 1. Import statements that rely on PyTorch are replaced with JAX or other libraries.
# 2. Variables declared with torch.Variable are now jnp.array or jnp.device variable.
# 3. Operations using PyTorch functions are replaced with JAX functions or native JAX code.

# However, without the specific original code, it's challenging. But the user's initial code example includes a reinforcement learning setup with PyTorch, and the task is to convert that to JAX.

# Given the original code's first part:

import gym
import math
import random
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import namedtuple
from itertools import count
from copy import deepcopy

# Converted to JAX:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import random as jrandom
from jax import vmap
from jax.sharding import shard
from jax.core.utils import get_jax_driver

# Get JAX driver
get_jax_driver()

# Define the environment step

class JAXEnv:
    def __init__(self):
        self.env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2").unwrapped()  # Assuming gym is compatible or needs adaptation

    def step(self, action):
        # Assuming the environment function is adapted to JAX
        next_state, reward, done, info =... # JAX-compatible code
        return next
