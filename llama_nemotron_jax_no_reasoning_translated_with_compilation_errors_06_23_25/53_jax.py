use jax.numpy as NP
Replace PyTorch with JAX's equivalents.
Replace tensor operations with jax.numpy or jax.device_map

Replace `torch.optim` with `jax.jax.nn.optim` and use jax.profiler instead of torch.optim.

Replace `torch.autograd.Function` with `jax.autograd.Function`.

Replace `torch.nn.Module` with `jax.nn.Module`.

Replace `torch.randn` with `jax.numpy.random.normal`.

Replace `torch.sin` with `jax.numpy.sin`, etc.

Also, the code uses PyTorch for neural network modules. Replace `torch.nn.Linear` with `jax.nn.Linear`.

Replace `torch.zeros` with `jax.numpy.zeros`, etc.

In the original code, the neural network is defined as follows:

class PolicyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(PolicyNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)
        self.output = nn.Linear(output_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return self.output(x)

Replace with:

class PolicyNet(jax.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(PolicyNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = jax.nn.Linear(input_dim, 128)
        self.fc2 = j_jax.nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = jax.nn.Linear(64, output_dim)
        self.output = jax.nn.Linear(output_dim, 1)

Wait, but jax uses `jax.jax.nn` or just `jax.nn`? Probably, in JAX, you can import from jax.nn directly. But the code may need to adjust the imports.

But the user wants only valid JAX code, replacing the PyTorch parts.

Looking at the original code:

They have:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.autograd as tautog

So in JAX, these would be replaced with:

import jax
import jax.nn as jnn
import jax.optim as jopt
import jax.autograd as jautog

But the user's code may not include all imports, but the answer should only output the code parts.

But according to the problem, the user wants the code translated to JAX, outputting only valid JAX code.

So, the code provided by the user includes:

- Gym interaction
- Some imports (PyTorch)
- Environment setup
- Neural network definition
- Training loop

We need to translate each part.

First, the imports:

Original:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.autograd as tautog

JAX equivalents:

import jax
import jax.nn as jnn
import jax.optim as jopt
import jax.autograd as jautog
import gym
import math
import random
import numpy as np
from collections import namedtuple
from copy import deepcopy
from PIL import Image

But the user's code may have other imports, but we need to focus on the code that uses PyTorch.

Next, the environment setup:

Original:

env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2").unwrapped
use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available()
FloatTensor = torch.cuda.FloatTensor if use_cuda else torch.FloatTensor
#... 

JAX doesn't have a direct equivalent of `use_cuda`, but JAX can run on CPU/GPU. So we can remove the CUDA-specific code.

In JAX, the environment can be created with gym, and it will automatically use GPU if available.

So:

env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2").open()  # maybe.open() is needed for JAX? Or not?

But in the original code, they call env.reset() later. So perhaps:

env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2")

Then, the test loop:

for _ in range(1000):
    env.render()
    env.step(env.action_space.sample()) # take a random action

In JAX, the environment's step and render may work differently. But according to JAX docs, gym environments should work similarly.

Next, the neural network:

Original:

class PolicyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(PolicyNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)
        self.output = nn.Linear(output_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2
