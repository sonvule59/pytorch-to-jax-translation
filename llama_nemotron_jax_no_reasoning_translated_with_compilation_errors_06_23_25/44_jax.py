Okay, I need to convert the given PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by looking at each part of the code.

First, the imports. PyTorch uses `torch`, but JAX uses `jax`. However, in JAX, when writing models, it's common to use `jax.nn.Module` instead of `torch.nn.Module`. But the user might expect the code to use JAX's equivalent functions. Wait, the original code has classes and functions; in JAX, maybe the structure would be similar, but perhaps using JAX's data structures.

Looking at the RestoreUtilsTest1 class. The test cases use PyTorch functions like `serialize_state_dict`, `get_linear_param_names`, etc. For JAX, the equivalents might be different. Wait, JAX has `jax.nn.Module`, `jax.train.state_dict`, and similar utilities. But the user's code might need to be adjusted to use JAX's API.

Wait, the user's instruction says to output valid JAX code. So I need to replace PyTorch-specific functions with their JAX counterparts. For example, `serialize_state_dict` in PyTorch has a JAX equivalent, but maybe in JAX, when saving and loading models, we use `save` and `load` functions for models. Or perhaps the code is using JAX's JIT compiler, but the original code isn't using autotune yet.

Wait, the original code has a class `RestoreUtilsTest1` with test methods. The setup saves a model's state dict, inputs, and outputs. Then tests loading it. The key parts are the model definitions and the serialization functions.

The model MNISTSparseCNN in PyTorch uses KWinners. In JAX, maybe the module would be defined using `jax.nn.Module` with submodules. But JAX doesn't have a built-in KWinners module. Wait, but the user's code might be using a custom module. However, the original code includes KWinners from torch.nn.modules. So in JAX, perhaps the equivalent is not present, but the user's code might need to be adjusted. But since the user wants to translate the code, maybe the model definitions would look similar but use JAX's data types.

Wait, but the user's code might not be using JAX's specific modules but rather a PyTorch model. So when converting to JAX, the model would be a JAX nn.Module, but the specific layers would need to be adapted. However, the original code's MNISTSparseCNN might not be directly translatable. But perhaps the user's main focus is on the restore utils and the conversion of functions like serialize_state_dict to JAX.

Looking at the functions: In PyTorch, `serialize_state_dict` writes the state dict to a buffer. In JAX, when saving a model, you might use `save` and `load` functions. But perhaps the code is using JAX's `jax.train.state_dict` for saving. Alternatively, the JAX version might use `save` for model states. However, the original code uses `pickle` to save the state. But JAX has its own way of handling model serialization.

Wait, the original code uses `pickle` to save the state dict. But in JAX, models can be saved using `save` and `load` functions. So maybe the `serialize_state_dict` in PyTorch is being replaced with JAX's save/load. But the user's code might need to use JAX's equivalents.

Alternatively, the code might need to use JAX's `jax.nn.Module`, and the state dict would be saved using `save` and `load`. Let me check the PyTorch and JAX functions.

In PyTorch, `serialize_state_dict` writes the state dict to a buffer. In JAX, when you save a model, you can use `save` and `load` functions. For example:
