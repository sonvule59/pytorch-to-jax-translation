Note: The original code uses PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` and `nn.Conv2d`, etc. JAX doesn't use the same names for these classes. Use JAX's equivalents:
- `jax.nn.Conv2d`, `jax.nn.Sequential`, 
- `jax.nn.Linear` for fully connected layers.
Also, JAX requires all tensors to be mapped to the device (GPU or CPU) explicitly.
In JAX, the `forward` method is called `map_fn` in the Vectors API, but for Neural Networks, the model's `forward` method should work similarly, but outputs are JAX tensors on the device.
However, JAX's `DataLoader` and `Data` classes are similar to PyTorch's but require JAX's `jax.data.Dataset` instead of `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. 
To adapt the code, replace PyTorch's data loaders with JAX's equivalents. However, since the user requested to output only valid JAX code and the original code uses PyTorch's DataLoader, we'll need to adjust accordingly.

But since the user instructed to output only valid JAX code and the original code uses PyTorch's DataLoader, which is not JAX-compatible, but the user wants the code translated to JAX, but the code provided is PyTorch code.

However, the user wants the code translated to JAX, but the model class uses PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` and `nn.Conv2d`, etc. JAX uses different class names. So, we need to replace all PyTorch classes with JAX equivalents.

But the user's instruction is to output only valid JAX code. So, the code needs to be adapted accordingly.
