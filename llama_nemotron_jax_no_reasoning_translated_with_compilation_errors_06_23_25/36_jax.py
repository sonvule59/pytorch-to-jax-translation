Note: The JIT compilation is optional and depends on the JAX configuration. The code uses PyTorch's JIT but can be adapted for JAX by replacing torch with jsax.pytorch or similar.

But the task is to convert the given Python code (which uses PyTjax) to JAX code. So need to replace PyTorch with JAX's equivalents.

Original code uses PyTorch and TorchJIT. But the user wants to convert to pure JAX.

So, the main steps are:

1. Replace PyTorch with JAX's torch/jax.

But in JAX, you don't import torch, but use jax.numpy as jax.

Also, JAX doesn't have TorchJIT in the same way. Instead, JAX has just-in-time compilation enabled by default.

So, the code should be rewritten using JAX's types.

Let's go line by line.

First, the imports:

Original:

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

JAX equivalent:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax.shapedArrays as jaa

But JAX uses jax.shapedArrays for some operations. However, for simplicity, maybe just use jnp.

So, replace with:

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import jit

But the user said to output only valid JAX code. So, the imports would be:

But the user's code didn't have any imports except PyTorch. So, the JAX code should import jax and related modules.

But the user's code has functions. Let's process each function.

First function:

@torch.jit_circle
def calculate_distances(...) ->...

In JAX, JIT is done with @jit, but for functions, you can use @jit(device='cpu') or just @jit(). However, the original code uses @torch.jit_circle which is PyTorch's JIT command. In JAX, the equivalent is @jit().

But the user's code may not need JIT, but the original code uses @torch.jit_circle. However, the user wants to translate the code to JAX. So, the JIT decorator can be removed, or replaced with JAX's JIT.

But the first function:

Original:

@torch.jit_circle
def calculate_distances(p0: torch.Tensor, p1: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    Dij = torch.sqrt(F.relu(torch.sum((p0 - p1) ** 2, -1)))
    return Dij

In JAX:

We can remove the JIT decorator, as JAX compiles by default. Or, if we want to explicitly JIT, use @jit.

But the user's code may not require JIT. So, the JAX version would be:

def calculate_distances(p0: jnp.ndarray, p1: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
    Dij = jnp.sqrt(jnp.relu(jnp.sum((p0 - p1) ** 2, axis=-1)))
    return Dij

But the original code uses PyTorch's tensors. In JAX, the equivalent is jnp.array or jnp.ndarray.

But the user's code may need to be adapted to use JAX's types.

Also, the input tensors are PyTorch tensors. In JAX, you can convert them using jnp.array, but in a JAX context, it's better to use JAX arrays.

So, the function would use jnp.

Second function:

def calculate_torsions(p0: torch.Tensor, p1: torch.Tensor, p2: torch.Tensor, p3: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    b0 = -1.0 * (p1 - p0)
    b1 = p2 - p1
    b2 = p3 - p2

    if p0.dim() == 1:
        b1 /= b1.norm()
    else:
        b1 /= b1.norm(dim=1)[:, None]

    v = b0 - torch.sum(b0 * b1, dim=-1, keepdim=True) * b1
    w = b2 - torch.sum(b2 * b1, dim=-1, keepdim=True) * b1

    x = torch.sum(v * w, dim=-1)
    y = torch.sum(torch.cross(b1, v) * w, dim=-1)

    return torch.atan2(y, x)

In JAX, replace torch with jnp, and adjust the dimensions.

Let's process each line.

b0 = -1.0 * (p1 - p0) → jnp.array(-1.0 * (p1 - p0))

b1 = p2 - p1 → jnp.array(p2 - p1)

b2 = p3 - p2 → jnp.array(p3 - p2)

Then, the if condition
