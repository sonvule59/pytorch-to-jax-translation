Okay, I need to convert the provided PyTorch code to JAX. Let me start by understanding what the original code does.

The PyTorch code defines a Lightnet class, which is a network module. It has different ways of being used, either by overriding forward() or by defining loss and postprocess functions. The default forward function handles cases where layers are Sequential or ModuleList.

In JAX, the approach is different. JAX uses VAPI (Virtual Application Programming Interface) and requires explicit compilation. Also, JAX doesn't have direct equivalents to PyTorch's nn.ModuleList or nn.Sequential. So I need to adjust the architecture accordingly.

First, the JAXLightnet class provided in the answer has some custom layers. But the original Lightnet in PyTorch is more general. So maybe the JAX code should mirror the structure of the PyTorch code but adapted to JAX's VAPI.

Looking at the JAX code provided in the answer, it's a custom Lightnet class with specific layers. But the original PyTorch code is more of a
