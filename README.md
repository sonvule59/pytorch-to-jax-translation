# LLM-Powered PyTorch to JAX Translation & Automated Verification

## Overview

This repository provides a robust, automated pipeline for **translating PyTorch code to JAX using Large Language Models (LLMs)** and verifying correctness via automated testing. It is designed for researchers and practitioners seeking reproducible, reliable code migration from PyTorch to JAX.

## This research is a part of my Master Project.
