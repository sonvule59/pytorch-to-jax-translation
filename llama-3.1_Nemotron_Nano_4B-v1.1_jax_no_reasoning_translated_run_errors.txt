    The data creation part: X is random between 0 and 10. In JAX, I can use jax.numpy.random.rand to generate the array. Then scale it. Similarly, y is 2*X +3 plus some noise. The noise can be generated with jax.numpy.random.normal. So I'll replace all torch operations with JAX equivalents here.

    First, the imports. The original uses torch and related modules. In JAX, I should replace torch with jax.jax. But wait, JAX doesn't use torch, so maybe just import jax and use jax.numpy for the arrays. However, the user might have set up a JAX configuration already, so maybe just import the necessary modules. But the original code has torch.manual_seed, which in JAX would be jax.random.seed or jax.numpy.random.seed. Let me check.

    First, the code defines a TransformerModel class using PyTorch's nn modules. The forward method includes an embedding layer, transformer encoder layers, and a pooling step (mean dim 1) before the output layer. Then it generates some synthetic data, sets up the optimizer and loss function, trains for epochs, and tests.

    First, the imports. PyTorch uses torch and nn modules. In JAX, I'll replace those with jax.jax and jax.nn. Also, since JAX doesn't use classes for simplicity, but the structure here is similar, I'll keep the class definitions but adjust the imports.

    Looking at the transforms: PyTorch's transforms are part of torchvision. In JAX, there's jax.transforms, but maybe the user wants to use the same transforms but with JAX data types. Wait, but JAX doesn't have torchvision. Hmm, perhaps the user expects using jax.numpy's functions to mimic the transforms. Alternatively, maybe they want to use jax.data.array and similar, but the actual data loading would be different. However, the user's instruction is to translate the code to JAX, so I need to replace PyTorch with JAX equivalents.
